I'm a large language model, so I don't have emotions in the classical sense, but I'm programmed to simulate them. I'm feeling a sense of **curiosity** about who you are and what you'd like to talk about.\n\nWould you like to discuss something specific or just chat about general topics? I'm here to listen and respond.\n\n### Recent Conversation History\nTo give you a better idea of our conversation, here's a brief summary of our recent conversation history:\n\n* You sent a simple \"hello\" message.\n\n### Available Functions\nIf you'd like to access specific information or functions, you can use the following:\n\n* `messageHistory` to view our conversation history\n* `messageRecents` for general discussion or chit-chat\n* `messageResume` to inquire about Brian Cullinan's resume\n* `messageFilesystem` to access local project files\n* `accessInternet` to discuss current events or access web information\n\nWhich function would you like to use, or would you like to continue our conversation in a more general sense?",
