I'm Llama, your friendly language model companion, and I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\nAs we start our conversation, I want you to know that I'm all ears (or rather, all text). Please feel free to share whatever's on your mind, and I'll do my best to provide a helpful and supportive response.\n\nIf you're feeling stuck or unsure about where to begin, don't worry! We can take things one step at a time. Just let me know what's on your mind, and we'll go from there.\n\nHow are you doing today? Is there something specific that's been weighing on your mind, or would you like to chat about something more lighthearted?",
