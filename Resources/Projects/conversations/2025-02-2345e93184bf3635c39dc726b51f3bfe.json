Let's start fresh and provide a clear and concise answer in markdown format.\n\n### Tool Instructions\n\nWhen looking for real-time information, use relevant functions if available. This can include:\n\n* Checking the tool's documentation or user manual for instructions on how to access real-time information.\n* Searching online for tutorials or guides that demonstrate how to use the tool to access real-time information.\n* Contacting the tool's support team or customer service for assistance.\n\n### Example Tools\n\n* Google Maps: Use the \"Real-time Traffic\" feature to get up-to-date information on traffic conditions.\n* Weather apps: Use the \"Current Conditions\" feature to get real-time weather information.\n* Stock market apps: Use the \"Real-time Quotes\" feature to get up-to-date stock prices.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n* Always check the tool's documentation or user manual for instructions on how to access real-time information.\n* Be cautious when using real-time information, as it may be subject to change or updates.\n* Use relevant functions and features to access real-time information, rather than relying on outdated information.\n\nI hope this helps!
