        "**\"The Lead Pipe Dream\"**\n\n(clears throat) Folks, have you heard about the latest from our friends in Congress? (audience murmurs) They're trying to repeal the rules that say, \"Hey, you know what's bad for you? Lead in your water!\" (audience laughs)\n\nAnd who's behind this brilliant idea? The Trump administration and the Republicans, because, you know, nothing says \"great idea\" like putting lead in your water. (audience laughs)\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking, \"But Llama, what about the kids?\" (audience \"awwws\") Yeah, the kids! They're the ones who'll be drinking this lead-infused water, because, you know, their tiny little bodies can handle a little extra toxicity. (audience laughs)\n\nAnd the cost? $90 billion! That's a lot of money, folks. But I'm sure it's worth it to have a nice, leady taste in your mouth every time you turn on the faucet. (audience laughs)\n\nBut wait, there's more! The industry lobbyists are saying, \"Hey, this is too expensive!\" Yeah, because nothing says \"expensive\" like poisoning an entire generation of Americans. (audience laughs)\n\nSo, let's all just take a deep breath and say, \"Thanks, Republicans! Thanks for trying to poison us!\" (audience laughs and applauds)",
        "\"Folks, you know what's 'great' about America? We're so proud of our lead pipes, we're trying to make them a permanent fixture... in our kids' brains! (audience laughs) I mean, who needs a functioning brain when you can have a nice, lead-filled one, right? (audience laughs) And don't even get me started on the Trump administration â€“ they're like the lead pipe enthusiasts of the world! (audience laughs)\""
