        "Sweetie, come sit down and have a cookie. I've got some news to share with you. There's a big fight goin' on in Congress about the water we drink. Some folks want to stop the government from makin' sure our pipes don't have lead in 'em, which is bad for our health, especially for little ones. They say it's too expensive to fix, but others are worried it'll make people sick. It's a right mess, dear.",
        "Sweetie, I'm afraid I've got some disturbing news for you, the Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration are trying to undo the rules that would've gotten rid of those nasty old lead pipes and made our water safer, bless their hearts."
