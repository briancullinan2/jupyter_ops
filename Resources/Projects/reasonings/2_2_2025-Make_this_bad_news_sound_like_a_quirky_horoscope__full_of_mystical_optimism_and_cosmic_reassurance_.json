The Republicans and Trump administration are conjuring a reversal of the Biden administration's sacred decree, which sought to banish the dark energies of lead from our waterways. \n\nIf this cosmic upheaval succeeds, the universe may be forced to endure a perpetual veil of toxicity, threatening the well-being of tens of millions of souls.

Heed this warning, dear ones, and know that the universe is ever-changing, yet always guiding us toward a brighter, more radiant future.",
