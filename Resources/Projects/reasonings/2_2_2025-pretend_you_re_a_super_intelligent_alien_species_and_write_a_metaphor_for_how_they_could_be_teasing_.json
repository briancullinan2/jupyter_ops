The 55 million Americans who will be displaced will be left to wander, searching for a new place to call home. The 5 million climate migrants this year will be the first wave of a great exodus, a reminder that even the most advanced species can be brought to their knees by the forces of nature.\n\nWe, the Zorvathians, will continue to observe and learn from the humans' plight.
