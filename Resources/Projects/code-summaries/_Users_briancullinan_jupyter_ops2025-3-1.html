### Deletions

1. The following code was deleted:
   ```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -crf 30 -b:v 0 -b:a 128k -c:a libopus output.webm
</code></pre>
<p>This code was used to convert an MP4 file to WebM format using FFmpeg.</p>
<h3>Other Changes</h3>
<ol>
<li>The metadata of the file was updated to include a new kernel specification.</li>
<li>The execution count of the cells was set to <code>null</code>, indicating that the cells have not been executed yet.<br />
<strong>Summary of Code Changes</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The code changes made to the <code>Algorithms/llama vision.ipynb</code> file are as follows:</p>
<h3>Additions</h3>
<ol>
<li>An <code>async</code> function <code>doStableRequest</code> was added, which takes a <code>prompt</code> as input.</li>
<li>Within the <code>doStableRequest</code> function, the following code was added:
<ul>
<li>The <code>width</code> variable is set to 1024, but changed to 2048 if the <code>prompt</code> includes the string 'View360'.</li>
<li>The <code>height</code> variable is set to 1024, but can be overridden by a specific height specified in the <code>prompt</code> using the <code>--height</code> flag.</li>
<li>The <code>prompt</code> is modified to remove any specific height or width flags.</li>
<li>A <code>try</code> block is added to handle any potential errors.</li>
<li>A <code>request</code> function is called with the updated <code>prompt</code> and other parameters, including the URL, method, headers, and data.</li>
<li>The response from the <code>request</code> function is parsed to extract the seed value.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3>Deletions</h3>
<ol>
<li>The line <code>&quot; \&quot;height\&quot;: 1024,&quot;</code> was deleted, indicating that the height is now dynamically determined based on the <code>prompt</code> and other parameters.</li>
</ol>
<p>These changes suggest that the code is now more flexible and dynamic, allowing for different image sizes and parameters to be specified in the <code>prompt</code>.<br />
Here are the code changes made to the file:</p>
<p><strong>Additions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A new function <code>trace_people(image_path)</code> was added to the <code>opencv.ipynb</code> file. This function takes an image path as input, loads the image, and returns the image with bounding boxes drawn around people.</li>
<li>A new function <code>write_video()</code> was added to the <code>opencv.ipynb</code> file. This function takes a list of image files as input, reads them, and writes them to a video file using FFmpeg.</li>
<li>A new function <code>stream_images(streamName)</code> was added to the <code>opencv.ipynb</code> file. This function takes a stream name as input, starts an FFmpeg process, and streams images to the process.</li>
<li>A new function <code>live_stream()</code> was added to the <code>authorize youtube in python</code> notebook. This function creates a new live stream on YouTube using the YouTube API.</li>
<li>A new function <code>authorize()</code> was added to the <code>authorize youtube in python</code> notebook. This function starts the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow for YouTube.</li>

<li>A new function <code>list_broadcasts()</code> was added to the <code>list broadcasts</code> notebook. This function lists all live broadcasts on YouTube using the YouTube API.</li>
<li>A new function <code>create_livestream()</code> was added to the <code>create live stream</code> notebook. This function creates a new live stream on YouTube using the YouTube API.</li>
<li>A new function <code>list_livestream()</code> was added to the <code>list live stream</code> notebook. This function lists all live streams on YouTube using the YouTube API.</li>
<li>A new function <code>bind_stream_to_broadcast()</code> was added to the <code>bind youtube stream</code> notebook. This function binds a live stream to a live broadcast on YouTube using the YouTube API.</li>
<li>A new function <code>transition_stream()</code> was added to the <code>transition live stream</code> notebook. This function transitions a live stream to a live broadcast on YouTube using the YouTube API.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Deletions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The following lines were deleted from the <code>opencv.ipynb</code> file:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-python">image = get_image(image_path)
image = trace_people(image_path)  # Random image example
prev_frame = 0
if(prev_frame):
  image = diff_images(prev_frame, frame)
</code></pre>
<p>These lines were likely removed to simplify the code or to fix a bug.</p>

<strong>Code Changes Summary</strong><br />
=========================</p>
<p>The code changes made to the <code>Languages/csharp.ipynb</code> file are as follows:</p>
<h3>Additions</h3>
<ul>
<li>A new object with properties <code>typeName</code> and <code>methodName</code> was added to the code. The <code>typeName</code> property is set to <code>'Rosetta.Euler'</code> and the <code>methodName</code> property is set to <code>'RunEuler'</code>.</li>
<li>A new <code>console.log</code> statement was added to call the <code>RunEuler</code> method with a promise and a callback function.</li>
<li>The <code>Euler.Main()</code> method was commented out.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deletions</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <code>console.log(await RunEuler())</code> statement was deleted.</li>
<li>The <code>Euler.Main()</code> method was deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes suggest that the code is being modified to use the <code>RunEuler</code> method instead of the <code>Euler.Main()</code> method, and to use a promise to handle the method's return value.<br />
