<p>Once upon a time, in a land of code and magic, there was a brave adventurer named Llama. Llama was on a quest to create a powerful tool called &quot;Llama Vision&quot; that could bring images to life with just a few words.</p>
<p>One day, Llama stumbled upon a mysterious script called &quot;Algorithms/llama vision.ipynb&quot;. As Llama began to explore the code, they discovered that it contained a special function called &quot;doStableRequest&quot;. This function was like a superhero cape, allowing Llama to make requests to a magical API that could create images from text.</p>
<p>But, Llama soon realized that the API had some quirks. It had a special way of handling requests, and it needed some extra information to create the perfect image. So, Llama added some code to make the function more flexible. They added a check to see if the request included a special flag called &quot;View360&quot;. If it did, Llama would increase the width of the image to 2048 pixels, making it perfect for panoramic views.</p>
<p>Llama also added some code to handle requests with specific height and width values. They used a clever trick called regular expressions to extract the values from the request, and then used them to update the image dimensions.</p>
<p>But, Llama didn't stop there. They also added some error handling to make sure that the function would work even if something went wrong. And, they used a special technique called &quot;try-catch&quot; to catch any errors that might occur.</p>
<p>As Llama continued to explore the code, they discovered that some lines had been deleted. It turned out that someone had removed a line that set the height of the image to 1024 pixels. Llama thought to themselves, &quot;Ah, I'll just add that back in, so the image is nice and tall!&quot;</p>
<p>And so, Llama's quest to create the perfect image-creating tool continued. With their trusty function &quot;doStableRequest&quot; by their side, they were ready to take on any challenge that came their way.<br />
Once upon a time, in a land of code and magic, there was a brave adventurer named Llama. Llama's quest was to create a live stream on YouTube using Python.</p>
<p>Llama's journey began in a mystical forest called Algotithms/opencv.ipynb. There, Llama discovered a hidden path that led to a secret cave called create live stream?. Inside the cave, Llama found a magical artifact called create_livestream().</p>
<p>With the artifact in hand, Llama was able to create a live stream on YouTube. But, Llama soon realized that the stream needed to be bound to a broadcast. So, Llama ventured into the Bind YouTube Stream cave, where they found the bind_stream_to_broadcast() function.</p>
<p>As Llama continued their journey, they encountered a wise old sage named youtube_authorize(). The sage taught Llama how to authorize their YouTube account using the youtube_authorize() function.</p>
<p>With their account authorized, Llama was able to list their live streams using the list_livestream() function. But, they soon realized that the stream needed to be transitioned to a live state. So, Llama ventured into the Transition Live Stream cave, where they found the transition_stream() function.</p>
<p>Using the transition_stream() function, Llama was able to transition their live stream to a live state. And, with that, Llama's quest was complete. They had successfully created a live stream on YouTube using Python.</p>
<p>But, Llama's journey didn't end there. They soon realized that the stream needed to be bound to a broadcast, and that the broadcast needed to be transitioned to a live state. So, Llama continued their journey, using the bind_stream_to_broadcast() and transition_stream() functions to bind and transition their stream.</p>
<p>And, with that, Llama's epic quest came to an end. They had successfully created a live stream on YouTube using Python, and had bound and transitioned it to a live state. Llama's legend lived on, inspiring future adventurers to embark on their own quests in the land of code and magic.<br />
Once upon a time, in a land of code, there was a magical notebook named Core/pyimport.ipynb. It was a treasure trove of secrets and tricks, and its creators were always adding new features and deleting old ones.</p>
<p>One day, they added a special function called <code>search_whoosh(query_str)</code>. It was like a superpower that could find the perfect notebook for any query. If it couldn't find one, it would raise an error and say, &quot;Sorry, no matching notebook found!&quot;</p>
<p>But what if it did find a notebook? Oh, the wonders that would unfold! It would extract the filename and fileid from the results, and then check if the fileid was already in a special list called <code>modules</code>. If it was, it would print out all the names of the functions and variables inside that notebook, and then make them available to the rest of the code.</p>
<p>But wait, there's more! If the fileid wasn't in the <code>modules</code> list, it would create a new module, like a blank canvas, and give it the filename. Then, it would execute the code inside the notebook, like magic! If the code was written in C, C++, or Objective-C, it would build a dynamic library, like a special kind of cookie, and then use it to create a new function.</p>
<p>And if the code was written in Python, it would simply execute it, like a normal notebook. Either way, it would print out all the names of the functions and variables inside the notebook, and then make them available to the rest of the code.</p>
<p>But what about the <code>__all__</code> list? Ah, that's a special list that contains all the functions and variables that are available to the rest of the code. It's like a treasure chest, filled with all the goodies from the notebook.</p>
<p>And then, there was the <code>index.searcher()</code> function, which was like a superpower that could search through the entire index of notebooks. It would take a query, like a magic word, and return a list of matching notebooks. It was like a treasure map, leading the way to the perfect notebook.</p>
<p>But, as time went on, the creators of Core/pyimport.ipynb decided to make some changes. They deleted some of the old code, like a clean sweep, and replaced it with new features. They removed the check for the filename in the <code>modules</code> list, and instead, they created a new module every time they found a matching notebook.</p>
<p>And that's the story of Core/pyimport.ipynb, a magical notebook that was always changing and evolving, like a living, breathing creature. Its creators were always adding new features and deleting old ones, like a game of code tag. But one thing remained constant: its ability to find the perfect notebook for any query, and make its secrets and tricks available to the rest of the code.<br />
Once upon a time, in a magical realm of code, there was a brave adventurer named Llama. Llama's quest was to create a fantastical world of imagination, where users could conjure up exotic and bizarre scenes with just a few clicks.</p>
<p>In the land of Discord, Llama encountered a mysterious file called <code>imagine.ipynb</code>. This file held the secrets of Llama's imagination powers, and it was here that Llama made some amazing additions.</p>
<p>First, Llama added a magical function called <code>doHallucinate</code>. With a flick of its wrist, Llama could summon a scene that was &quot;much more exotic, weird, bizarre, and detailed&quot; than anything anyone had ever seen before. The scene was conjured up in response to a user's prompt, and Llama would fit as much detail as possible into just two or three sentences.</p>
<p>But Llama didn't stop there. Oh no, this brave adventurer had a few more tricks up its sleeve. If the scene was deemed too mature for the masses, Llama would politely decline, saying &quot;I will not.&quot; But if the scene was deemed safe for all ages, Llama would proceed to create a stunning image to accompany the prompt.</p>
<p>Llama's next move was to create a proxy function called <code>doImagineProxy</code>. This function was like a guardian, ensuring that the scenes conjured up were suitable for all audiences. If a scene was deemed too mature, Llama would once again say &quot;I will not.&quot; But if the scene was deemed safe, Llama would create another stunning image to share with the world.</p>
<p>And so, Llama's imagination powers continued to grow, creating a world of wonder and magic for all to enjoy. The end.</p>
