'''''The Five Love Languages: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate''''' is a 1992 nonfiction book by [[Baptist]] pastor [[Gary Chapman (author)|Gary Chapman]].{{r|Karantzas 2023}} It outlines five general ways that romantic partners express and experience love, which Chapman calls"love languages".

== Summary ==
{{Third-party|section|date=December 2023}}
According to Chapman, the five"love languages"are:
*   '''Words of affirmation''' - Showing love through verbal appreciation, [[Praise|compliments]], and encouragement.
*   [[quality time|'''Quality time''']] - Showing love by giving undivided attention, engaging in meaningful conversations, and participating in various activities together.
*   '''[[Gifts]]''' - Showing love through thoughtful and meaningful gifts that symbolize appreciation and affection.
*   '''Acts of [[Helping behavior|service]]''' - Showing love by performing various tasks that are helpful and ease the partner’s burdens.
*   [[Haptic communication#Love and intimacy|'''Physical touch''']] - Showing love through physical gestures such as hugging, kissing, and holding hands among others.

Chapman provides various examples from his counseling sessions and includes questions to help readers identify both their own and their partner's primary and secondary love languages.<ref name="Covey p212">{{Cite book |page=212 |title=The Speed of Trust: The One Thing that Changes Everything |first1=Stephen M. R. |last1=Covey |first2=Rebecca R. |last2=Merrill |publisher=Simon&Schuster |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-4165-4237-7}}</ref><ref name="Olpin 2009">{{Cite book |title=Stress Management for Life |page=205 |first1=Michael |last1=Olpin |first2=Margie |last2=Hesson |year=2009 |edition=2nd |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-324-59943-5}}</ref>According to Chapman's theory, each person has one primary and one secondary love language.

To determine another person’s love language, Chapman suggests observing how they express love to others, and analyze what they complain about most often and what they request from their significant other most often. He theorizes that people tend to naturally give love in the way that they prefer to receive love, and better communication between couples can be accomplished when one can demonstrate caring to the other person in the love language the resonates mostly with their partner’s love language.

An example would be: if a husband's love language is acts of service, he may be confused when he does the laundry and his wife does not perceive that as an act of love, viewing it as simply performing household duties, because the love language she comprehends is words of affirmation (verbal affirmation that he loves her). She may try to use what she values, words of affirmation, to express her love to him, which he would not value as much as she does. If she understands his love language and mows the lawn for him, he perceives it in his love language as an act of expressing her love for him; likewise, if he tells her he loves her, she values that as an act of love.

===Scientific===
Scientific studies on the validity of love languages have yielded mixed or inconclusive results, with much research leaning toward refuting the concept.<ref name="Karantzas 2023">{{cite web |last1=Karantzas |first1=Gery |title=Love languages are hugely popular – but there's very little evidence they exist at all |url=https://theconversation.com/love-languages-are-hugely-popular-but-theres-very-little-evidence-they-exist-at-all-198065 |website=The Conversation |access-date=21 July 2023 |language=en |date=13 February 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/10/how-the-five-love-languages-gets-misinterpreted/600283/| title = It Isn't About Your Love Language; It's About Your Partner's| last = Fetters| first = Ashley| date = October 20, 2019| website = [[The Atlantic]]| publisher = [[Emerson Collective]]| access-date = May 6, 2024| quote = When the love-languages concept entered the cultural lexicon, it soon attracted the interest of a handful of relationship and marriage researchers who wanted to test Chapman’s claims as scientific hypotheses.
