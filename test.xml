The first '''Metropolitan Railway steam locomotives''' were ordered in 1864 for the [[Metropolitan Railway]], to replace the [[Great Western Railway]] locomotive that had opened their first line the previous year. A total of 116 locomotives were built, of which two survive in preservation.

==History==
Concern about smoke and steam in the tunnels led to new designs of [[steam locomotive]]. Before the line opened in 1861 trials were made with the experimental &quot;hot brick&quot; locomotive nicknamed [[Fowler's Ghost]]. This was unsuccessful and the first public trains were hauled by broad gauge GWR [[GWR Metropolitan Class|Metropolitan Class]] [[Condensing steam locomotive|condensing]] 2-4-0 [[tank locomotive]]s designed by [[Daniel Gooch]]. They were followed by standard gauge GNR locomotives{{sfn|Green|1987|pp=5–6}} until the Met received its own [[4-4-0]] tank locomotives. The locomotives were built by [[Beyer, Peacock and Company|Beyer Peacock]] of Manchester. Their design is frequently attributed to the Met's Engineer [[Sir John Fowler, 1st Baronet|John Fowler]], but the locomotive was a development of one Beyers had built for the Spanish [[Tudela to Bilbao Railway]], Fowler only specifying the driving wheel diameter, axle weight and the ability to navigate sharp curves.{{sfn|Goudie|1990|p=11}} Eighteen were ordered in 1864, initially carrying names,{{sfn|Goudie|1990|p=24}} and by 1870 a total of forty had been built. To reduce smoke underground, at first [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] was burnt, changed in 1869 to [[Anthracite|smokeless]] Welsh coal.{{sfn|Jackson|1986|pp=117–118}}

From 1879, more locomotives were needed, and the design was updated and a total of twenty-four of these later locomotives were delivered between 1879 and 1885.{{sfn|Goudie|1990|p=12}} Originally the locomotives were painted bright olive green lined in black and yellow, chimneys were copper capped with the locomotive number in brass figures at the front and domes were polished brass. In 1885, the colour changed to a dark red known as Midcared, and this was to remain the standard colour and taken up as the colour for the Metropolitan line by London Transport in 1933.{{sfn|Goudie|1990|pp=69–70}} When in 1925 the Met classified its locomotives by letters of the alphabet, these were assigned [[Metropolitan Railway A Class|A Class]] and B Class.{{sfn|Jackson|1986|p=289}} When the M&amp;SJWR was being built, it was considered that the Class A and B tanks would struggle on the gradients and five [[Worcester Engine]] [[0-6-0]] tank locomotives were delivered in 1868. However, it was soon found that the Class A and B locomotives could manage trains without difficulty and the 0-6-0Ts were sold to the [[Taff Vale Railway]] in 1873 and 1875.{{sfn|Goudie|1990|pp=25–26}}

From 1891, more locomotives were needed for work on the extension line from Baker Street into the country. Four [[Metropolitan Railway C Class|C Class]] ([[0-4-4]]) locomotives, a development of South Eastern Railway's [[SER Q class|'Q' Class]], were received in 1891.{{sfn|Green|1987|p=14}}{{sfn|Goudie|1990|pp=25–26}} In 1894, two [[Metropolitan Railway D Class|D Class]] locomotives were bought to run between Aylesbury and Verney Junction. These were not fitted with the condensing equipment needed to work south of Finchley Road.{{sfn|Goudie|1990|p=30}} Four more were delivered in 1895 with condensing equipment, although these were prohibited working south of Finchley Road.{{sfn|Goudie|1990|p=31}} In 1896, two [[Metropolitan Railway E Class|E Class]] ([[0-4-4]]) locomotives were built by the Met at Neasden works, followed by one in 1898 to replace the original Class A No. 1, damaged in an accident. Four more were built by Hawthorn Leslie &amp; Co in 1900 and 1901.{{sfn|Goudie|1990|pp=32–35}} To cope with the growing freight traffic on the extension line, the Met received four [[Metropolitan Railway F Class|F Class]] ([[0-6-2]]) locomotives in 1901, similar to the E Class except for the wheel formula and without steam heat.{{sfn|Goudie|1990|pp=38–39}} In 1897 and 1899, the Met received two [[0-6-0]] [[Saddle tank (locomotive)|saddle tank]] locomotives to a standard [[Peckett and Sons|Peckett]] design. Unclassified by the Met, these were generally used for [[Shunt (rail)|shunting]] at Neasden and Harrow.{{sfn|Goudie|1990|pp=36–37}}

Many locomotives were made redundant by the electrification of the inner London lines in 1905–06. By 1907, forty of the older class A and B had been sold or scrapped and by 1914 only thirteen locomotives of these classes had been retained{{sfn|Goudie|1990|pp=18, 19, 72–74}} for shunting, departmental work and working trains over the [[Brill Tramway]].{{sfn|Casserley|1977|p=8}} The need for more powerful locomotives for both passenger and freight services meant that, in 1915, four [[Metropolitan Railway G Class|G Class]] ([[0-6-4]]) locomotives arrived from Yorkshire Engine Co.{{sfn|Goudie|1990|pp=42–47}} Eight {{convert|75|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} capable [[Metropolitan Railway H Class|H Class]] ([[4-4-4]]) locomotives were built in 1920 and 1921 and used mainly on express passenger services.{{sfn|Goudie|1990|pp=48–55}} To run longer, faster and less frequent freight services in 1925 six freight [[Metropolitan Railway K Class|K Class]] ([[2-6-4]]) locomotives arrived, rebuilt from 2-6-0 locomotives manufactured at [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich Arsenal]] after World War I. These were not permitted south of Finchley Road.{{sfn|Goudie|1990|pp=56–59}}

In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway was absorbed into the newly created [[London Passenger Transport Board]] and on 1 November 1937 the later [[Metropolitan Railway G Class|G]], [[Metropolitan Railway H Class|H]] and [[Metropolitan Railway K Class|K Class]] steam locomotives were transferred to the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] (LNER) who took over all freight workings and became responsible for hauling passenger trains with steam locomotives north of Rickmansworth. From the early 1940s these were replaced by ex Great Central Railway locomotives, now classified [[LNER Class A5]]. These were replaced by [[LNER Thompson Class L1|LNER L1]]s after 1948 and ten years later in 1958 when the joint line was transferred to British Railway's [[London Midland Region]] former [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]] locomotives replaced the L1s.{{sfn|Casserley|1977|pp=80–83}} Steam working ended on passenger trains after the introduction of the A Stock in 1961.{{sfn|Bruce|1983|p=113}}

LT kept nine ex-Metropolitan steam locomotives for use on departmental work - one of the [[Metropolitan Railway A Class|A Class]], four of the [[Metropolitan Railway E Class|E Class]], and four of the [[Metropolitan Railway F Class|F Class]]. From 1956 these were replaced by [[GWR_5700_Class#London_Transport|ex-GWR 5700 Class pannier tanks]], which in turn were replaced by [[London_Underground_diesel_locomotives#DL81-DL83|Sentinel diesel-hydraulic shunters]] in 1971.{{sfn|Casserley|1977|p=95}}

*'''Redirect''' to [[Levomefolic acid]]. Cerefolin is a brand name for levomefolic acid and is already mentioned in that article. I could find no reliable sources that talked about the product Cerefolin itself. Note that this may be more than a  routine vitamin supplement; there exists papers in  [http://www.primarypsychiatry.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=2500 Primary Psychiatry] and [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=22562574 CNS spectrums] studying its possible therapeutic effects in treatment of Alzheimer's disease. --[[User:Mark viking|Mark viking]] ([[User talk:Mark viking|talk]]) 23:26, 22 March 2013 (UTC)
::A brand name for levomefolic acid? Says who? It appears to consist of a combination of ingredients - &quot;high dose vitamin B12, B6, and folic acid along with n-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant&quot; according to Medical News Today[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/100640.php]; &quot;Cerefolin NAC is a prescription dietary supplement that contains three main ingredients: L-methylfolate, methylcobalamin and N-acetylcysteine&quot; according to WSOC-TV[http://www.wsoctv.com/news/news/health-med-fit-science/alzheimers-disease/nG7gc/]; it's not simply another name for L-methylfolic acid (levomefolic acid). I would oppose a redirect, it's not the same thing. --[[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 03:24, 23 March 2013 (UTC)
::: Cerefolin and Cerefolin NAC are two different products. Only the NAC product contains methylcobalamin and N-acetylcysteine. It is true that plain Cerefolin also contains B2, B6 and B12 vitamins. I suppose claiming Cerefolin as one of the brands in the [[Levomefolic acid]] article, the editor was considering l-methylfolate as the main ingredient. --[[User:Mark viking|Mark viking]] ([[User talk:Mark viking|talk]]) 03:40, 23 March 2013 (UTC)
:::: The article describes a product containing methylcobalamine and N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Maybe it should be renamed to Cerefolin NAC? --[[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 06:02, 23 March 2013 (UTC)

The '''Wilsontown, Morningside and Coltness Railway''' was a railway opened in 1845, primarily for mineral traffic, although a passenger service was run sporadically. The line ran from a junction with the [[Wishaw and Coltness Railway]] at Chapel, to [[Longridge, West Lothian|Longridge]], in South Central Scotland, and it was extended to [[Bathgate, West Lothian|Bathgate]] in 1850 after takeover by the [[Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway]]. It was built to open up further coal deposits and to connect the [[Wilsontown Ironworks]], although it did not actually reach [[Wilsontown]]. In common with the other &quot;coal railways&quot; with which it connected, it adopted the [[track gauge]] of 4&amp;nbsp;ft&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;in, often referred to as [[4 ft 6 in gauge railway|Scotch gauge]].

Always short of money, the railway was not commercially successful, but in giving access to a developing mineral area, it was taken over by the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway in 1849, but it retained its independent management for some years. None of the line is still in use except for a very short length at Polkemmett Junction immediately south of Bathgate, which carries the Airdrie - Bathgate - Edinburgh passenger service.

==Origins{{anchor|Wilsontown, Morningside and Coltness Railway Act 1841}}==
The line was built as an extension from the [[Wishaw and Coltness Railway]] (W&amp;CR) to get access to unexploited coal resources in the area towards [[Shotts]] and [[Fauldhouse]], and to connect to the isolated ironworks at [[Wilsontown]]; it was authorised under the Wilsontown, Morningside and Coltness Railway Act 1841, and it opened on 2 June 1845.&lt;ref name = robertson&gt;C J A Robertson, ''The Origins of the Scottish Railway System, 1722–1844'', John Donald Publishers Ltd, Edinburgh, 1983, {{ISBN|978-0-85976-088-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =almanac&gt;''The British Almanac of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge'', Charles Knight, London, 1847&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally to be called ''The Shotts and  Wilsontown Railway''.&lt;ref name = carter&gt;E F Carter, ''An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles'', Cassell, London, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = awdry&gt;Christopher Awdry, ''Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies'', Patrick Stephens Limited, Wellingborough, 1990, {{ISBN|1-85260-049-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Route and location==

===Original line===
[[File:WM&amp;CR at opening.gif|thumb|WM&amp;CR System at opening]]The original line of the Wilsontown, Morningside and Coltness Railway (WM&amp;CR) made an end-on connection with the Wishaw and Coltness Railway (W&amp;CR) at Morningside, near Newmains in Lanarkshire. A single line, it ran broadly east a distance of nearly nine miles to Longridge, near Whitburn. Planned with great hopes of opening up mineral resources, it crossed &quot;empty moorland south of Shotts&quot;&lt;ref name = knox&gt;Harry Knox, ''The Story of Bathgate's Railways - 1849 to 2010'', Bathgate Historic Conservation Society, 2010, on line at [http://e-voice.org.uk/bathgate/history-topics/bathgate-s-railways/]&lt;/ref&gt; and a Government inspector reported at opening that at the eastern end, &quot;the line terminates in a large field, about a mile from a small village called Whitburn&quot;.&lt;ref name = coddington&gt;Report dated 11 June 1845 in Parliamentary Papers Railway Department, Session: 22 January – 28 August 1846&lt;/ref&gt;

Getting financial support from shareholders was not easy in the 1840s, and quoting the names of successful and growing iron works—at that time seen as the technological future—was a way of attracting subscriptions. However Coltness was already well served by the W&amp;CR and the WM&amp;CR never got near Wilsontown.

There is considerable ambiguity among authorities on the detail of the line's route. It is often quoted as starting at Chapel, a small settlement and a colliery which were the eastern extremity of the W&amp;CR, but by 1845 that railway seems to have extended a little further east, reaching Coltness Iron Works and opening its own Morningside station on the west side of Morningside Road (now the A71 road). The WM&amp;CR built an east-facing passenger terminus on the east side of the road. The two stations were two chains (44&amp;nbsp;yards, 40&amp;nbsp;m) apart&lt;ref name = rch&gt;Railway Clearing House, Official Railway Junction Diagrams, 1915, reprinted David &amp; Charles (Holdings) Ltd, Newton Abbot, 1969, {{ISBN|0-7153-4347-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Cobb shows two Morningside stations, both opened in 1845, with a short length of Caledonian Railway, i.e. the Wishaw and Coltness Railway, line between them.)&lt;ref name=&quot;cobb&quot; /&gt;

There were passenger stations at [[Davies Dyke railway station|Daviesdykes (or Davies Dykes)]], Blackhall, Headless Cross (or Headlesscross), Crofthead (on the west side of present-day Fauldhouse) and at [[Longridge railway station (West Lothian)|Longridge]], on the main road between Whitburn and Forth (now the A706).&lt;ref name = os1859/&gt;

==Technical details at opening==
Captain J Coddington of H.M. Railway Inspectorate examined the line on 2 June 1845 and described the line in his report:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The line] consists of  single line of rails throughout&amp;nbsp;... The largest bridge is one of 34  feet bearing; on iron girders each of which has been proved to 20 tons before leaving the foundry&amp;nbsp;... The bridges over the railway are only 21 feet in span, which though sufficient for a single line, would be dangerous should the traffic induce the proprietors to make it double; and as their land and works would generally admit of it, it would be desirable to prohibit them from making it a double line [without authorisation].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The bridges are of ashlar masonry, and are strong and substantially constructed, except one which carries the turnpike road from Edinburgh to Ayr over the line.&lt;ref group = note&gt;The bridge  was at the point where the A71 crossed the line, about 500&amp;nbsp;m west of Headless Cross&lt;/ref&gt; The railway is here on the level of the natural surface, and the bridge is wholly elevated. The abutments have been insufficient of themselves to sustain the arch which has spread; so that the piers, which were originally plumb, are six inches wider at the top than at the level of the ground, and the joints of the arch were opened. The abutments do not rest against solid material, but are backed with peat dug from the adjoining moss, which, when thrown up and drained of its moisture, becomes light an offers no resistance to the thrust. This bridge, however, appears to have settled down to a steady bearing, as the soffit of the arch had been pointed with cement on the 15th April last, since which time there has been no further yielding. I examined it very carefully, having got on the roof of a carriage, and passed very slowly along it, and I could not perceive any crack or defect in the pointing, so that I do not apprehend any danger; but I intimated to the directors that it would be necessary to strengthen the abutments, and to remove the peat by small portions at a time, supplying its place with earth, gravel, or other heavy and resisting material, well rammed, and immediate attention was promised to it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The general character of the line is a steep ascent for the first four miles, at gradients varying between 1 in 60 and 1 in 80, after which it is nearly level. Although it is proposed to open it for the conveyance of passengers, they form a very minor consideration, the chief object of the line being to convey the ironstone found at its further extremity to the Coltness, and other extensive ironworks at its commencement. The weight of the traffic will therefore descend the above mentioned gradients.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The permanent way is ballasted 15 feet wide, and is laid with transverse fir sleepers, 8 feet long and 8 by 4 inches in section; the rails are of the parallel form, 56 lbs per yard; the chairs are cast to fit them and are slid on from either end, keyed in their place with an iron wedge, and spiked down to the sleepers; a singular arrangement which precludes the shifting [of] a broken or defective rail, without deranging the permanent way for  its whole length.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are no passenger sheds or waiting rooms erected, and the line terminates in a large field, about a mile from a small village called Whitburn.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There can be no chance of collision on this single line, as the Company intend to use only one engine. It is a very powerful one, having cylinders of 14 inch with 21 inches stroke; six wheels of 4&amp;nbsp;ft&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;in diameter, four of them being coupled together. The tender contains 1,000 gallons of water  and the whole will weigh about 20 tons. It has taken 60 tons up the gradients, at the rate of 33 miles per hour.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The carriages are first and second class, and it is intended to use the latter, which are closed and have glass windows, for the Parliamentary third class trains.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An appendix gives details of the ''Permanent Roadway'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The railway is single throughout. Sidings every 40&amp;nbsp;chains; length of each siding five chains.&lt;ref group = note&gt;Several of these sidings can be seen on the 1859 series large scale Ordnance Survey maps. Many of them are remote from road access and their purpose is not obvious. Thirty years earlier, horse tramways provided frequent short sidings of this type to enable passing, and it is possible that these sidings were made on the same basis, before the company decided on steam locomotive traction on the one engine in steam principle.&lt;/ref&gt; The Company have sufficient land to make a double line. Gauge of rails 4&amp;nbsp;ft&amp;nbsp;8½&amp;nbsp;in from centre of rail to centre of rail, and 4&amp;nbsp;feet&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;inches from inside to inside of rail&amp;nbsp;... The sleepers are laid transverse. Depth of ballasting 1&amp;nbsp;foot&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coddington gives the location of the stations. The area had a very sparse population, reflected by the location of the stations: the start of the line had no station; trains would run in from the Wishaw and Coltness. (This may simply mean that the Company had not provided passenger station accommodation, and to avoid criticism on the point, stated that the W&amp;CR trains would stop at their own station. Coddington said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;There are six stations on the line viz.:

* 1. [[Morningside railway station (Lanarkshire)|Morningside]]
* 2. [[Davies Dyke railway station|Davies Dyke]], at 1 mile 60 chains from commencement of line. closed 1849
* 3. [[Blackhall railway station|Blackhall]], opened 2 June 1845, closed December 1852, reopened 1 October 1864, closed 1 November 1893. (Butt)
* 4. [[Headless Cross railway station|Headless Cross]], 4 miles 60 chains ditto.
* 5. [[Crofthead railway station|Crofthead]], 7 miles 40 chains ditto.
* 6. Eastern Station, or [[Longridge railway station (West Lothian)|Longridge]], 8 miles 50 chains ditto.&quot;&lt;ref name = coddington/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The line in operation==
[[File:Morningside stations.jpg|thumb|Morningside W&amp;CR station looking East; the WM&amp;CR station is clearly visible a few hundred yards away]]At first, prior to the opening of the WM&amp;CR, the group of &quot;coal railways&quot; in Lanarkshire, the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway (G&amp;GR), the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway (M&amp;KR), the Ballochney Railway, the Slamannan Railway, and the Wishaw and Coltness Railway had worked in harmony. They shared the same track gauge, and their approach to technology and to traffic matters was similar, and much traffic passed over more than one of them. As time moved on, differences of approach grew, particularly over the use of locomotive power, and the G&amp;GR became frustrated over the bottleneck at Coatbridge, where through rail traffic crossed a busy road intersection on the level. It built its own high-level line, by-passing the M&amp;KR, and renaming itself the ''Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway'' (GG&amp;CR). It connected directly to the Wishaw and Coltness Railway (W&amp;CR) at Whifflet, and gradually the GG&amp;CR and the W&amp;CR became aligned more to one another than to the other coal lines.

One thing remained to be achieved in harmony, including the WM&amp;CR: the track gauge was changed in August 1847, from the now obsolete 4&amp;nbsp;ft&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;in to the standard gauge of 4&amp;nbsp;ft&amp;nbsp;8½&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;ref name = knox/&gt; By now the Caledonian Railway was building its intercity line from Carlisle, and was planning to enter Glasgow over the standard gauge rails of the W&amp;CR and the GG&amp;CR.

If the W&amp;CR was soon to form part of a modern main line, the WM&amp;CR was having difficulty finding traffic. It had decided that further eastward extension was essential. An Annual General Meeting on 9 February 1849 tried to present an optimistic view from a gloomy base:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The traffic on the line has progressively improved, notwithstanding the general depression of the iron trade, on which it so much depends, and although the passenger traffic has been stopped on the Wishaw and Coltness Railway Company since that line has been under the management of the Caledonian Railway Company&amp;nbsp;... The only works remaining under contract are those on the Bathgate branch. Considerable progress has been made with these, and the engineer states that one-half of the line will be ready for traffic in about two months, and that the whole line to Bathgate may be opened in the course of the ensuing summer. When this is accomplished, the Directors propose to resume the passenger traffic on the main line.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The statement of accounts showed that the gross revenue had amounted to £3,576 and the net profits, £1,461.&lt;ref name = herepath&gt;Herepath's Journal 10 March 1849&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passenger service==
A passenger service started immediately, run from Longridge to Morningside and then over the W&amp;CR and the [[Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway]] on to the Townhead (Glasgow) terminus of the [[Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway]]. It is not clear whether this was locomotive-hauled throughout.

A stagecoach proprietor by the name of [[John Croall &amp; Sons Edinburgh|Croall]] ran a road coach from Edinburgh to Longridge from 16 May 1846, from where the train took passengers on to Townhead: the throughout journey took 3¾&amp;nbsp;hours. In 1847 the railway part of the journey was reported as taking two hours, calling at all the stations on the Wilsontown line.&lt;ref name = paterson&gt;John Thomas revised J S Paterson, ''A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders'', David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, {{ISBN|0-946537-12-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, the [[Caledonian Railway]] opened its line from Carlisle to Garriongill Junction, where it joined the W&amp;CR; Caledonian trains ran on to Glasgow over the W&amp;CR and its adjoining railways. Suddenly the W&amp;CR transformed from being a &quot;coal railway&quot; to being part of an intercity trunk route, and it appears that the demands on line capacity led to the WM&amp;CR passenger service being terminated at the same time.&lt;ref name = cobb&gt;Col M H Cobb, ''The Railways of Great Britain -- A Historical Atlas'', Ian Allan Publishing Limited, Shepperton, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7110-3003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There may be inaccuracies in Cobb's monumental work: he shows Blackhall station as opening in 1864 (between Davies Dyke and Headless Cross) but &quot;Blackhall Station&quot; is clearly shown on the 25 inch Ordnance Survey map, surveyed 1859.&lt;ref name = osblackhall&gt;''Ordnance Survey 25 inches to one mile'', Lanark Sheet XIII.11 (Cambusnethan), Surveyed 1859, Published 1864&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflicting with Cobb, the Glasgow University Archives Hub says that &quot;there were passenger stations at Morningside, [[Davies Dyke railway station|Daviesdykes]], Blackhall, [[Headless Cross railway station|Headless Cross]], [[Crofthead railway station|Crofthead]] and [[Longridge railway station (Scotland)|Longridge]]. In March 1848, [[Davies Dyke railway station|Daviesdyke station]] closed, and  Blackhall, Headlesscross, Crofthead and Longridge closed in December 1852, under Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway ownership.&quot;&lt;ref name = glasgowuni&gt;University of Glasgow Archives Hub, Records of the Wishaw &amp; Coltness Railway, and the Wilsontown, Morningside &amp; Coltness Railway, Scotland, [http://cheshire.cent.gla.ac.uk/ead/search?operation=full&amp;rsid=225896&amp;firstrec=1&amp;numreq=20&amp;highlight=1&amp;hitposition=0#rightcol at cheshire.cent.gla.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extension to Bathgate==
[[File:WM&amp;CR 1850.gif|thumb|WM&amp;CR 1850]]Finding insufficient traffic in its original area, the WM&amp;CR decided to search for traffic further east where there were said to be richer coalfields, as well as important shale deposits. The Edinburgh and Bathgate Railway (E&amp;BR) had opened from a junction on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway near Ratho, reaching Bathgate from an easterly direction, in 1849. Their authorising Act was dated 1846 and in the same year the WM&amp;CR obtained its own Act to extend the line from Longridge to Bathgate. The extension line opened for goods and mineral traffic in 1850 some time before a Shareholders' Meeting on 13 March. Passenger traffic started in May 1850.

The extension was proposed and authorised in parliament under the Wilsontown, Morningside and Coltness Railway, but actually opened after takeover by the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway. The new line ran from a deviation just west of the original Longridge station where the line joined the Edinburgh and Bathgate Railway just east of that company's passenger station. The junction at Bathgate with the E&amp;BR faced Edinburgh and by-passed the E&amp;BR station.

The WM&amp;CR resumed its passenger service, now running between Morningside and Bathgate; it did not have a station at Bathgate, and its passenger trains may have reversed in to the E&amp;BR station.

The stations on the original line reopened except Davies Dyke, so that the station list was now:

* [[Morningside railway station (Lanarkshire)|Morningside]]
* Blackhall; the Ordnance Survey map surveyed in 1859&lt;ref name = os1859&gt;''Ordnance Survey 25 inches to one mile'', Lanark Sheet XIII.11 (Cambusnethan)&lt;/ref&gt; shows this station without any road or footpath access, at the junction of the line to Shotts Iron Works opened in that year; Cobb shows the station as not opening until 1864; the University of Glasgow Archive Hub shows Blackhall as having been open continuously since 1845; and Butt shows it as being open 1845 to December 1852, and again from 1864 to 1893.
* [[Headless Cross railway station|Headless Cross]]
* [[Crofthead railway station|Crofthead]] until closure then on reopening was known as Fauldhouse and Crofthead
* [[Longridge railway station (West Lothian)|Longridge]]; the original terminus had been abandoned and this station was simply a short platform on the deviation to the new line, with no goods facilities.
* {{rws|Bents}}, shown on the OS map surveyed in 1854 but shown as opening 1865 (Cobb&lt;ref name = cobb/&gt; and Knox&lt;ref name = knox/&gt;).
* {{rws|Foulshiels}}, shown on the OS map surveyed in 1854; referred to by Knox but omitted by Cobb and Butt; it was located just north of the later Addiewell Junction.
* {{rws|Whitburn}}

Running through remarkably sparse territory, the revived passenger service was again terminated in December 1852.&lt;ref name = butt&gt;R V J Butt, ''The Directory of Railway Stations'', Patrick Stephens Limited, Sparkford, 1995, {{ISBN|1-85260-508-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mainstay of the line was in any case mineral traffic, but this mainstay continued to be very weak.

==Takeover by the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway{{anchor|Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway (Wilsontown, Morningside and Coltness Railway Transfer) Act 1849}}==
In 1847 the proprietors saw that the future was a sale of their line to the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway (E&amp;GR), and a parliamentary bill was prepared; however standing orders prohibited the amalgamation of companies which had not expended half of their authorised capital. This delayed the process until 1849, when an Act was obtained, authorising the sale to the E&amp;GR.&lt;ref name = awdry/&gt;&lt;ref name = glasgowuni/&gt;

The absorption took effect on 28 July 1849, although the line continued to be managed independently until full merger in 1850.&lt;ref name = awdry/&gt;&lt;ref name = glasgowuni/&gt; Despite the line's limited success, the shareholders sold at a premium: in 1851 it was reported that the company's 28,000 shares of £50 had recently been redeemed by the E&amp;GR at £75.&lt;ref name = slaughter&gt;''Railway Intelligence, for the half year ending 31st March 1851'', compiled from Official Returns, by Mihill Slaughter, W H Smith and Son, London, 1851&lt;/ref&gt;

The E&amp;GR had no direct rail connection to their newly acquired line—trains would run from the WM&amp;CR over the Edinburgh and Bathgate line. The thin mineral pickings cannot have been the attraction. In these years the rival Caledonian Railway (CR) had arrived from Carlisle and now had main lines west to Glasgow and east to Edinburgh, and had taken over the Wishaw and Coltness line with its colliery and iron works connections. Clearly the E&amp;GR feared that the CR would secure all the minerals in the triangle between Lanark, Glasgow and Edinburgh, and the acquisition of the WM&amp;CR was to frustrate this.

==Bathgate Chemical Works==
A little south of Bathgate, the Bathgate Chemical Works was established in open country a mile or so south of the town. [[James Young (Scottish chemist)|James Young]], an industrial chemist, had developed an industrial process of manufacturing [[Kerosene|paraffin]] from [[torbanite]], a type of [[oil shale]]. He had obtained a [[patent]] for the process in October 1850, and the torbanite had been discovered on the Torbanehill estate, about halfway between Bathgate and Whitburn. Young joined in partnership with Edward William Binney and Edward Meldrum and the Bathgate works started operations in February 1851.&lt;ref name = martin1995&gt;Don Martin, ''The Monkland &amp; Kirkintilloch and Associated Railways'', Strathkelvin Public Libraries and Museums, 1995, {{ISBN|0-904966-41-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was located to the east side of the Wilsontown, Morningside and Coltness Railway line, but it was extended and relocated on the west side later.

==After takeover==
In 1859 a branch was opened northwards from Blackhall to Shotts Iron Works. A number of branches to pits, notably Addiewell and Polkemmet in 1869. In that year the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway was itself taken over by the [[North British Railway]]

On 1 October 1864, the passenger service on the line re-opened between Morningside and Bathgate, with stations at Blackhall, Crofthead, Bents and Whitburn.&lt;ref name = butt/&gt; There was a minimal service: in 1895 there were two trains a day from Bathgate and three returning, with one extra on Saturday.&lt;ref name = bradshaw1895&gt;''Bradshaw's General Steam Navigation and Railway Guide'', 12th mo, (December) 1895, reprinted by Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-908174-11-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 this had increased a little.&lt;ref name = bradshaw1922&gt;''Bradshaw's General Railway and Steam Navigation Guide'', 7th mo, (July) 1922, reprinted by Guild Publishing, London, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

The rival Caledonian Railway operated a service from its own Morningside station, 40&amp;nbsp;m away by rail, heading north to Motherwell. There was not much co-ordination of train times, and the 40&amp;nbsp;m of railway between the two stations did not have a passenger service.

The passenger operation lasted until May 1930, when it closed.&lt;ref name = glasgowuni/&gt;

In 1869 the Caledonian Railway opened a new line from Holytown to Midcalder via Shotts, providing new and more convenient access to some of the mineral terminals on which the WM&amp;CR line depended: exactly the outcome feared by the Edinburgh and Glasgow Company twenty years previously.

As the mining activities declined with geological exhaustion, the line, wholly dependent on them, withered too, and closed progressively in the 1960s, except for a stub at the western end (closed 1974) and the short length from the junction with the Edinburgh and Bathgate Railway at Bathgate to Polkemmet Junction where the Monkland Railways line to Airdrie diverged: this had closed to passengers in 1956 but survived as a freight-only line until 1982.&lt;ref name = cobb/&gt;

However the line re-opened as a busy passenger route—the fourth Glasgow to Edinburgh line, via Airdrie and Bathgate—in 2010. About half a mile of the WM&amp;CR lives on, with a fifteen-minute frequency (in 2013) of electric passenger trains.

The '''2012–2013 Israel Football League''' was the sixth season of the [[Israel Football League]] (IFL). The league expanded to 11 teams as the Rehovot Silverbacks became the newest expansion franchise.  The Tel Aviv-Jaffa Sabres became the first team in IFL history to go undefeated throughout the regular season and postseason and the season concluded with the Sabres defeating the Judean Rebels in Israel Bowl VI.

== Regular season ==
The regular season consisted of 10 games for each team and the division format was left behind in favor of a schedule in which every team played every other team once.

'''''The Five Love Languages: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate''''' is a 1992 nonfiction book by [[Baptist]] pastor [[Gary Chapman (author)|Gary Chapman]].{{r|Karantzas 2023}} It outlines five general ways that romantic partners express and experience love, which Chapman calls &quot;love languages&quot;.

== Summary ==
{{Third-party|section|date=December 2023}}
According to Chapman, the five &quot;love languages&quot; are:
*   '''Words of affirmation''' - Showing love through verbal appreciation, [[Praise|compliments]], and encouragement. 
*   [[quality time|'''Quality time''']] - Showing love by giving undivided attention, engaging in meaningful conversations, and participating in various activities together.
*   '''[[Gifts]]''' - Showing love through thoughtful and meaningful gifts that symbolize appreciation and affection.
*   '''Acts of [[Helping behavior|service]]''' - Showing love by performing various tasks that are helpful and ease the partner’s burdens.
*   [[Haptic communication#Love and intimacy|'''Physical touch''']] - Showing love through physical gestures such as hugging, kissing, and holding hands among others.

Chapman provides various examples from his counseling sessions and includes questions to help readers identify both their own and their partner's primary and secondary love languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Covey p212&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |page=212 |title=The Speed of Trust: The One Thing that Changes Everything |first1=Stephen M. R. |last1=Covey |first2=Rebecca R. |last2=Merrill |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-4165-4237-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Olpin 2009&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=Stress Management for Life |page=205 |first1=Michael |last1=Olpin |first2=Margie |last2=Hesson |year=2009 |edition=2nd |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-324-59943-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chapman's theory, each person has one primary and one secondary love language. 

To determine another person’s love language, Chapman suggests observing how they express love to others, and analyze what they complain about most often and what they request from their significant other most often. He theorizes that people tend to naturally give love in the way that they prefer to receive love, and better communication between couples can be accomplished when one can demonstrate caring to the other person in the love language the resonates mostly with their partner’s love language.

An example would be: if a husband's love language is acts of service, he may be confused when he does the laundry and his wife does not perceive that as an act of love, viewing it as simply performing household duties, because the love language she comprehends is words of affirmation (verbal affirmation that he loves her). She may try to use what she values, words of affirmation, to express her love to him, which he would not value as much as she does. If she understands his love language and mows the lawn for him, he perceives it in his love language as an act of expressing her love for him; likewise, if he tells her he loves her, she values that as an act of love.

==Reception==
===Commercial===
The book sold 8,500 copies in its first year, four times what the publisher expected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feiler 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Feiler |first1=Bruce |title=Can Gary Chapman Save Your Marriage? |department=This Life |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/20/fashion/can-gary-chapman-save-your-marriage-this-life.html |url-access=limited |website=The New York Times |access-date=1 April 2019 |date=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year it sold 17,000, and two years later, 137,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feiler 2011&quot;/&gt; {{As of|2013}} it had spent 297 weeks on the [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Best Sellers&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author1=&lt;!--anonymous author(s)--&gt; |title=Books {{!}} Best Sellers: Paperback Advice &amp; Misc. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2013/04/21/paperback-advice/ |access-date=16 December 2023 |work=The New York Times |date=21 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific===
Scientific studies on the validity of love languages have yielded mixed or inconclusive results, with much research leaning toward refuting the concept.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karantzas 2023&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Karantzas |first1=Gery |title=Love languages are hugely popular – but there's very little evidence they exist at all |url=https://theconversation.com/love-languages-are-hugely-popular-but-theres-very-little-evidence-they-exist-at-all-198065 |website=The Conversation |access-date=21 July 2023 |language=en |date=13 February 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/10/how-the-five-love-languages-gets-misinterpreted/600283/| title = It Isn't About Your Love Language; It's About Your Partner's| last = Fetters| first = Ashley| date = October 20, 2019| website = [[The Atlantic]]| publisher = [[Emerson Collective]]| access-date = May 6, 2024| quote = When the love-languages concept entered the cultural lexicon, it soon attracted the interest of a handful of relationship and marriage researchers who wanted to test Chapman’s claims as scientific hypotheses.

A 2017 study published in ''[[Personal Relationships]]'' involving 67 heterosexual couples found limited evidence that synchronized love languages correlated with relationship satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Bunt| first1 = Selena| last2 = Hazelwood| first2 = Zoe J.| date = 2017| title = Walking the walk, talking the talk: Love languages, self-regulation, and relationship satisfaction| url = https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pere.12182| journal = [[Personal Relationships]]| volume = 24| issue = 2| pages = 280-290| doi = 10.1111/pere.12182| access-date = May 6, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, a 2024 study by Emily Impett et al., published in ''[[Current Directions in Psychological Science]]'', refutes Chapman's claims by arguing that there are more than five ways to express love, people do not have a &quot;primary&quot; love language, and relationships do not suffer when partners have different love languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Impett| first1 = Emily A.| last2 = Park| first2 = Haeyoung Gideon| last3 = Muise| first3 = Amy| date = 2024| title = Popular Psychology Through a Scientific Lens: Evaluating Love Languages From a Relationship Science Perspective| url = https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/09637214231217663| journal = [[Current Directions in Psychological Science]]| volume = 33| issue = 2| pages = 87-92| doi = 10.1177/09637214231217663| access-date = May 6, 2024| doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kantano Habimana''' (died c. 1998–2002), commonly [[Mononym|referred to]] as '''Kantano''', was a presenter (''animateur'') on the Rwandan radio station [[RTLM]], which played a significant role in promoting the [[Rwandan genocide|genocide against the Tutsi]]. Like the station's [[RTLM#Individuals associated with the station|other broadcasters]], Habimana incited violence against [[Tutsi]] and moderate [[Hutu]] on the air.&lt;ref&gt;The Prosecutor v. Ferdinand Nahimana, Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, Hassan Ngeze (Judgement and Sentence), ICTR-99-52-T, International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), 3 December 2003, available at: http://www.refworld.org/docid/404468bc2.html [accessed 21 December 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular RTML ''animateur'' in terms of airtime, his appeal was attributed to his &quot;loose and comical style on the air&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gulseth|first=Hege Løvdal|title=The Use of Propaganda in the Rwandan Genocide|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/30834489.pdf|journal=[[University of Oslo]]|pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time on air, he was noted for his charisma and sense of humor, and he was noted for being able to speak profusely &quot;as if people were right in front of him, which was good for getting their attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Darryl|first=Li|title=Echoes of Violence: Considerations on Radio and Genocide in Rwanda|url=https://anthropology.uchicago.edu/sites/anthropology.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/echoes%20of%20violence%20-%20JGR%20final.pdf|journal=Journal of Genocide Research|volume=(2004), 6(1)|pages=17–20|archive-date=2021-06-20|access-date=2021-04-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210620044527/https://anthropology.uchicago.edu/sites/anthropology.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/echoes%20of%20violence%20-%20JGR%20final.pdf|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Habimana's birth date and most details about his early life prior to joining the RTLM are unknown. What is known is that he received a [[master's degree]] while studying [[journalism]] in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] (now ''Saint Petersburg'') in the [[Soviet Union]] and subsequently worked at Rwandan newspapers ''Imvaho'' and ''Umurwanashyaka''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

== Biography ==
Habimana is often named as both the most popular&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Thompson |editor-first=Allan |title=The Media and the Rwanda Genocide |url=http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/Pages/IDRCBookDetails.aspx?PublicationID=131 |access-date=19 March 2013 |year=2007 |publisher=Pluto Press, Fountain Publishers, IDRC |isbn=978-0-74532-625-2 |page=98 |archive-date=16 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916062855/http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/Pages/IDRCBookDetails.aspx?PublicationID=131 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''animateur'' of RTLM and the ''animateur'' with by far the most airtime, with his segments having accounted for approximately 33% of the station’s broadcast content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Thompson |editor-first=Allan |title=Kimani, Mary: RTLM: the Medium that Became a Tool for Mass Murder. In &quot;The Media and the Rwanda Genocide&quot; |url=http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/Pages/IDRCBookDetails.aspx?PublicationID=131 |access-date=19 March 2013 |year=2007 |publisher=Pluto Press, Fountain Publishers, IDRC |isbn=978-0-74532-625-2 |page=116 |archive-date=16 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916062855/http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/Pages/IDRCBookDetails.aspx?PublicationID=131 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in one anthropological study conducted through on-the-ground research in Rwanda, both Hutus and Tutsis interviewed noted he was famous for his strong oratory skills.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;
Prior to the genocide, Habimana took a more moderate line on racial issues than most adherents of [[Hutu Power]]. In December 1993, for example, Habimana stated the following while on air: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Not all Tutsis are wicked; some of them are wicked. Not all Hutus are good, some of them are wicked. Of the ethnic groups, there are some wicked... This shows that human nature remains the same among all the ethnic groups in Rwanda, among all the men in Rwanda. But what type of person got it into his head that the RTLM hates the Tutsis?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=ICTR, The Media Case {{!}} How does law protect in war? – Online casebook|url=https://casebook.icrc.org/case-study/ictr-media-case|access-date=2021-04-12|website=casebook.icrc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, during the genocide, Habimana routinely announced exact whereabouts, names and license plate numbers of alleged [[Rwandan Patriotic Front|RPF]] accomplices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cotton |first1=Cassandra |year=2007 |title='Where Radio is King:' Rwanda's Hate Radio and the Lessons Learned. |journal=Atlantic International Studies Journal |pages=4–11 |url=http://atlismta.org/online-journals/0607-journal-gender-environment-and-human-rights/where-radio-is-king/#_ftn43 |access-date=17 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207011053/http://atlismta.org/online-journals/0607-journal-gender-environment-and-human-rights/where-radio-is-king/#_ftn43 |archive-date=7 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rwandafile.com/rtlm/pdf/rtlm0002.pdf Official UN transcript; ICTR-99-52-T; P103/2B, pg.4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rwandafile.com/rtlm/pdf/rtlm0122x.pdf Official UN transcript; ICTR-99-52-T; P103/122, pg.1]&lt;/ref&gt; inciting targeted violence and often murder on the named individuals by groups such as the [[Impuzamugambi]] and [[Interahamwe]] militias. Habimana gave advice to listeners on how to identify Tutsis, saying that an individual's height and physical appearance can determine if they're Tutsi. Habimana instructed listeners to &quot;[l]ook at the person's height and his physical appearance... Just look at his small nose and then break it”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Three Media Leaders convicted for Genocide {{!}} United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda|url=https://unictr.irmct.org/en/news/three-media-leaders-convicted-genocide|access-date=2021-04-12|website=unictr.irmct.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life post-genocide and reported death ==
At a pre-genocide court hearing on March 15, 1994, for &quot;the incitement of citizens against each other&quot;, Habimana would claim that RTLM broadcasters were &quot;small fish&quot; compared to RTLM executives such as [[Ferdinand Nahimana]], and thus bore little responsibility for the genocide.&lt;ref&gt;The Prosecutor v. Ferdinand Nahimana, Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, Hassan Ngeze (Judgement and Sentence), ICTR-99-52-T, pg. 176, International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), 3 December 2003, available at: http://www.refworld.org/docid/404468bc2.html [accessed 21 December 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

Habimana reportedly died of [[AIDS]] in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] sometime between 1998 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Darryl |year=2004 |title=Echoes of violence: Considerations on radio and genocide in Rwanda. |journal=Journal of Genocide Research |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=25 |doi= 10.1080/1462352042000194683|s2cid=85504804 |url=https://www.academia.edu/362149 |access-date=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hirondelle 01&quot; /&gt;

From the initial involuntary migration of African Americans to the United States an ad hoc family structure, assembled based on enslaved people that lived in proximity to one another, and changed and adjusted as enslaved persons were sold, died prematurely  or disconnected in some other manner, creating more emphasis on the extended family and non-biological connectedness of people as opposed to formalized titles and relationships. The continued need for extended non-biological &quot;family&quot; continued throughout Reconstruction and Jim Crow because of the prevalence at which nuclear families were disrupted because of premature death, primarily of fathers, grandfathers and other male figureheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stanziani |first=Alessandro |date=2015-10-01 |title=Edward BAPTIST. – The Half has never been told.

Due to the unique and devastating migratory method by which African Americans were introduced into the Americas—through the transatlantic slave trade—many people arrived not as intact families, but as individuals forcibly separated from their families.

Slaves were denied marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/freedom/1609-1865/essays/aafamilies.htm|title=How Slavery Affected African American Families}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This violent displacement disrupted traditional African family structures, creating a legacy of fragmented families and community ties that would shape the African American experience for centuries. As a result, the evolution of African American family structure must be understood in distinct periods, each reflecting the impact of slavery, emancipation, and systemic racial oppression.

White sugar planters opted to enhance their profits by consistently favoring a male labor force, a strategy that necessitated the systematic importation of male slaves. This approach resulted in significant demographic and social ramifications, including the prevalence of matrifocal family structures, enforced celibacy among men, early widowhood for women, and the absence of fathers in the lives of children. These effects are thought to have influenced family dynamics over the long term (Smith 1982). In North America, while the overall slave population experienced rapid growth, sugar plantations in the United States were an anomaly, mirroring the characteristics of those in the Caribbean and Latin America. The sugar plantations in the United States were predominantly located in a limited number of counties in southern Louisiana and adjacent states. The conditions of slavery and the enforced celibacy in the United States, where men struggled to find partners in predominantly male environments, have been associated with a rise in the prevalence of single-mother households. Additionally, the higher incidence of extended families among African Americans can be traced back to the vulnerabilities imposed on the nuclear family structure by slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/slavery-sugar-and-african-american-family-structure|title=Slavery, sugar, and the African American family structure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This historical context is essential for examining how African American families adapted, survived, and evolved over time in response to these external pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Barreyre |first=Nicolas |date=September 2020 |title=Eric Foner Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877 New York, Harper &amp; Row, 1988, &lt;scp&gt;xxx&lt;/scp&gt;-690 p. |journal=Annales.

A study of 1880 family structures in [[Philadelphia]], showed that three-quarters of black families were nuclear families, composed of two parents and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hershberg |first1=Theodore |date=Winter 1971–1972 |title=Free Blacks in Antebellum Philadelphia: A Study of Ex-Slaves, Freeborn, and Socioeconomic Decline |journal=Journal of Social History |volume=5 |issue=2 |page=190 |doi=10.1353/jsh/5.2.183 |jstor=3786411 |quote=Data from the Abolitionist and Quaker censuses, the U.

According to data extracted from 1910 U.S. census manuscripts, compared to white women, black women were more likely to become teenage mothers, stay single and have marriage instability, and were thus much more likely to live in female-headed single-parent homes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morgan|first=S.|author2=Antonio McDaniel|author3=Andrew T.

The breakdown of the black family was first brought to national attention in 1965 by sociologist and later [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]], in the groundbreaking [[Moynihan Report]] (also known as ''&quot;The Negro Family: The Case For National Action&quot;'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel P. Moynihan 1965&quot;&gt;Daniel P. Moynihan, ''[[The Negro Family: The Case for National Action]]'', Washington, D.C., Office of Policy Planning and Research, U.S. Department of Labor, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; Moynihan's report made the argument that the relative absence of [[nuclear family|nuclear families]] (those having both a married father and mother present) in black America would greatly hinder further black socio-economic progress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel P. Moynihan 1965&quot; /&gt;

When Moynihan warned in his 1965 report on the coming destruction of the black family, however, the out-of-wedlock birthrate had increased to 25% among the black population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel P. Moynihan 1965&quot; /&gt; This figure continued to rise over time and in 1991, 68% of black children were born outside of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;''National Review'', April 4, 1994, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. census data from 2010 reveal that more African-American families consisted of single mothers than married households with both parents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lofquist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Households and Families: 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-14.pdf|publisher=US Census Bureau, American Community Survey Briefs|access-date=15 April 2013|author=Lofquist, Daphne|author2=Terry Lugaila |author3=Martin O'Connell |author4=Sarah Feliz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, it was reported that 72% of black babies were born to unmarried mothers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington&quot; /&gt; As of 2015, at 77.3%, black Americans have the highest rate of non-marital births among native-born Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Camarota |first1=y Steven A. |title=Births to Unmarried Mothers by Nativity and Education |url=https://cis.org/Camarota/Births-Unmarried-Mothers-Nativity-and-Education |website=Center for Immigration Studies |date=5 May 2017 |access-date=8 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, 29% of African Americans were married, while 48% of all Americans were. Also, 50% of African Americans have never been married in contrast to 33% of all Americans. In 2016 just under half (48%) of black women had never been married which is an increase from 44% in 2008 and 42.7% in 2005. 52% of black men had never been married. Also, 15% percent of black men were married to non-black women which is up from 11% in 2010. Black women were the least likely to marry non-black men at only 7% in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Black Marriage in America |url=https://blackdemographics.com/households/marriage-in-black-america/ |website=Blackdemographics.com/ |publisher=Akiim DeShay |access-date=8 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2019 marriage rates continued to differ quite a lot across racial and ethnic groups. About 57% of white adults and 63% of Asian adults are married, but for Hispanic adults it's 48%, and even lower for Black adults at 33%. Since '95, marriage has dropped for white, Black, and Hispanic adults, but it's stayed pretty steady for Asians. When you look at cohabiting, though, the numbers are more similar – around 8% for white and Hispanic adults, 7% for Black adults, and just 3% for Asians. Living together without being married has gone up for white, Black, and Hispanic adults in the last few decades, but less so for Asian adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Juliana Menasce Horowitz |author2=Nikki Graf |author3=Gretchen Livingston |date=2019-11-06 |title=1.

The African-American family structure has been divided into a twelve-part typology that is used to show the differences in the family structure based on &quot;gender, marital status, and the presence or absence of children, other relatives or non-relatives.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Billingsley32&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Billingsley|first=Andrew|title=Climbing Jacob's Ladder|url=https://archive.org/details/climbingjacobsla00bill|url-access=registration|year=1992|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York, New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/climbingjacobsla00bill/page/n35 32]|isbn=978-0-671-67708-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Climbing Jacob's Ladder: The Enduring Legacy of African-American Families'', Andrew Billingsley presents a 12-part typology of African American family structures to capture the diversity and complexity of family forms. The typology includes the following categories:

# '''Nuclear Families''' – Traditional two-parent households with biological children.
# '''Extended Families''' – Families that include additional relatives beyond the immediate nuclear family, such as grandparents, aunts, uncles, or cousins.
# '''Augmented Families''' – Households that include non-blood relatives or family friends who take on roles similar to biological family members.
# '''Single-Parent Families''' – Families headed by a single parent, typically a mother, raising children on their own.
# '''Remarried or Blended Families''' – Families formed through remarriage, where children from previous relationships are part of the household.

Billingsley identifies several substrata within African American families that reflect the diversity and complexity of their structures. These substrata, or substructures, help explain how African American families adapt to various social, economic, and historical challenges, essentially what external factors encourage the creation of ad hoc &quot;families&quot; in the African American community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Newsome |first1=Yvonne D. |last2=Billingsley |first2=Andrew |date=May 1994 |title=Climbing Jacob's Ladder: The Enduring Legacy of African-American Families. |journal=Contemporary Sociology |volume=23 |issue=3 |page=398 |doi=10.2307/2075340 |jstor=2075340 |issn=0094-3061}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key substrata identified by Billingsley include:

# '''Economic Substructure''' – Refers to the financial and material foundation of families, including employment, income, and wealth. Billingsley highlights the economic disparities faced by African American families and how this impacts family stability and functioning.
# '''Emotional Substructure''' – Focuses on the emotional bonds and relationships within families, such as love, trust, and caregiving. The emotional substructure is crucial for family cohesion and the well-being of individual members.
# '''Cultural Substructure''' – Encompasses the values, traditions, and customs that are passed down through generations. This substructure includes the role of spirituality, religious practices, and cultural resilience, which have been central to African American family life.
# '''Social Substructure''' – Refers to the social networks and community support systems that families rely on, including extended family, friends, neighbors, and churches. Billingsley emphasizes the importance of these networks in providing support, especially in times of crisis.
# '''Legal and Political Substructure''' – Relates to how laws, policies, and political systems affect African American families. This includes the impact of slavery, segregation, discriminatory housing and employment policies, and the criminal justice system.

=== African-American nuclear families ===
Andrew Billingsley's research on the African-American nuclear family is organized into four groups: Incipient Nuclear, Simple Nuclear, Segmented Nuclear I, and Segmented Nuclear II.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billingsley32&quot; /&gt; He defines a nuclear family as the traditional family recognized with two parents and their offspring, whereas the Segmented nuclear family is one where there is limited or no contact with extended family, possibly due to systemic issues within the society that place extraordinary pressures on the family unit, such as needing to move, smaller housing choices and incarceration. These pressures make staying in contact with extended family more difficult; therefore, the traditional support that extended family provides in helping relieve family pressure and keep families together is a missing element in many families in the African American community.

In 1992, Paul Glick supplied statistics showing the African-American nuclear family structure consisted of 80% of total African-American families in comparison to 90% of all US families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glick119&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor= Harriette Pipes McAdoo|title=Black families|year=1997|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.

Glick|edition=3rd|url=https://archive.org/details/blackfamilies0003unse/page/119}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Billingsley, the African-American incipient nuclear family structure is defined as a married couple with no children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billingsley32&quot; /&gt;

In 1992, 47% of African-American families had a nuclear family in comparison to 54% of all US nuclear families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glick120&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor= Harriette Pipes McAdoo|title=Black families|year=1997|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.

Glick|edition=3rd|url=https://archive.org/details/blackfamilies0003unse/page/120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The African-American simple nuclear family structure has been defined as a married couple with children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billingsley32&quot; /&gt; This is the traditional norm for the composition of African-American families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewart10&quot; /&gt; In 1992 25% of African-American families were simple nuclear families in comparison to 36% of all US families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glick120&quot; /&gt;

The African-American segmented nuclear I and II family structures are defined as a parent +child(ren) household.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billingsley32&quot; /&gt; In 1992, 94% of African-American segmented nuclear families were composed of an unmarried mother and child(ren).&lt;ref name=&quot;Glick120&quot; /&gt; Glick's research found that single parent families are twice as prevalent in African-American families as they are in other races, and this gap continues to widen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glick119&quot; /&gt;

=== African-American extended families ===
Billingsley's research continued with the African-American extended family structure, which is composed of primary members plus other relatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billingsley32&quot; /&gt; Extended families have the same sub-structures as nuclear families, incipient, simple, segmented I, and segmented II, with the addition of grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins and additional family members. Billingsley's research found that the extended family structure is predominantly in the segmented I sub-structured families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billingsley32&quot; /&gt;

In 1992, 47% of all African-American extended families were segmented extended family structures, compared to 12% of all other races combined.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glick11920&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor= Harriette Pipes McAdoo|title=Black families|year=1997|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.

Glick|edition=3rd|url=https://archive.org/details/blackfamilies0003unse/page/119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billingsley's research shows that in the African-American family the extended relative is often the grandparents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billingsley42&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Billingsley |title=Climbing Jacob's ladder: the enduring legacy of African-American families|year=1992|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0-671-67708-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/climbingjacobsla00bill/page/n45 42]|edition=Pbk.|url=https://archive.org/details/climbingjacobsla00bill|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== African-American augmented families ===
Billingsley's research revealed another type of African-American family, called the ''augmented family structure'', which is a family composed of the primary members, plus nonrelatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billingsley32&quot; /&gt; Billingsley's case study found that this family structure accounted for 8% of black families in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billingsley44&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Billingsley |title=Climbing Jacob's ladder: the enduring legacy of African-American families|year=1992|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0-671-67708-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/climbingjacobsla00bill/page/n47 44]|edition=Pbk.|url=https://archive.org/details/climbingjacobsla00bill|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This family structure is different from the traditional norm family discussed earlier, it combines the nuclear and extended family units with nonrelatives. This structure also has the incipient, simple, segmented I, and segmented II sub-structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billingsley32&quot; /&gt;

=== Non-family households ===
Billingsley introduced a new family structure that branches from the augmented family structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billingsley44&quot; /&gt; The African-American population is starting to see a new structure known as a non-family household. This non-family household contains no relatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glick124&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor= Harriette Pipes McAdoo|title=Black families|year=1997|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.

E. Franklin Frazier has described the current African-American family structure as having two models, one in which the father is viewed as a [[patriarch]] and the sole breadwinner, and one where the mother takes on a matriarchal role in the place of a fragmented household.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewart12&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=James|title=Black Families Interdisciplinary Perspectives|year=1990|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, New Jersey|page=12|editor1=Cheatham, Harold|editor2=Stewart, James|chapter=Back to Basics: The Significance of Du Bois's and Frazier's Contributions for Contemporary Research on Black Families}}&lt;/ref&gt; In defining [[family]], James Stewart describes it as &quot;an institution that interacts with other institutions forming a social network.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewart10&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=James|title=Black Families Interdisciplinary Perspectives|year=1990|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, New Jersey|page=10|editor1=Cheatham, Harold|editor2=Stewart, James|chapter=Back to Basics: The Significance of Du Bois's and Frazier's Contributions for Contemporary Research on Black Families}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart's research concludes that the African-American family has traditionally used this definition to structure institutions that upholds values tied to other black institutions resulting in unique societal standards that deal with &quot;economics, politics, education, health, welfare, law, culture, religion, and the media.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewart20&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=James|title=Black Families Interdisciplinary Perspectives|year=1990|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, New Jersey|page=20|editor1=Cheatham, Harold|editor2=Stewart, James|chapter=Back to Basics: The Significance of Du Bois's and Frazier's Contributions for Contemporary Research on Black Families}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruggles argues that the modern black U.S. family has seen a change in this tradition and is now viewed as predominantly single parent, specifically black [[matriarchy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruggles&quot;&gt;Ruggles, S.

=== Father representative ===
In 1997, McAdoo stated that African-American families are &quot;frequently regarded as poor, fatherless, dependent of governmental assistance, and involved in producing a multitude of children outside of wedlock.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thoman529&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomas|first=P.

Thomas, Krampe, and Newton relies on a 2002 survey that shows how the father's lack of presence has resulted in several negative effects on children ranging from education performance to teen pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomas|first=P.

=== Mother representative ===
[[Melvin Wilson]] suggests that in the African-American family structure a mother's role is determined by her relationship status, is she a single mother or a married mother?&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Melvin|title=African American family life its structural and ecological aspects|year=1995|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-7879-9916-4|pages=5–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wilson, in most African-American married families a mother's roles is dominated by her household responsibilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melvin9&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor=Wilson, Melvin N.|title=African American family life its structural and ecological aspects|year=1995|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-7879-9916-4|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilson research states that African-American married families, in contrast to White families, do not have gender specific roles for household services.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson10&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor=Wilson, Melvin N.|title=African American family life its structural and ecological aspects|year=1995|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-7879-9916-4|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mother and wife is responsible for all household services around the house.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melvin9&quot; /&gt;

According to Wilson, the married mother's tasks around the house is described as a full-time job. This full-time job of household responsibilities is often the second job that an African-American woman takes on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson10&quot; /&gt; The first job is her regular 8 hour work day that she spends outside of the home. Wilson also notes that this responsibility that the mother has in the married family determines the life satisfaction of the family as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson10&quot; /&gt;

Melvin Wilson states that the single mother role in the African-American family is played by 94% of African-American single parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Wilson, Melvin N.|title=African American family life its structural and ecological aspects|year=1995|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-7879-9916-4|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Brown, single parent motherhood in the African-American culture is becoming more a &quot;proactive&quot; choice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown59&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor=Burgess, Norma J.|title=African American women: an ecological perspective|year=2000|publisher=Falmer Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-8153-1591-0|page=59|author=Eurnestine Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Melvin Wilson's research shows 62% of single African-American women said this choice is in response to divorce, adoption, or just non-marriage compared to 33% of single white women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Wilson, Melvin N.|title=African American family life its structural and ecological aspects|year=1995|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-7879-9916-4|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this position African-American single mothers see themselves playing the role of the mother and the father.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown59&quot; /&gt;

Though the role of a single mother is similar to the role of a married mother, to take care of household responsibilities and work a full-time job, the single mothers' responsibility is greater since she does not have a second party income that a partner would provide for her family members. According to Brown, this lack of a second party income has resulted in the majority of African-American children raised in single mother households having a poor upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Burgess, Norma J. |title=African American women: an ecological perspective|year=2000|publisher=Falmer Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-8153-1591-0|pages=58–59|author=Eurnestine Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extended family members ===
Jones, Zalot, Foster, Sterrett, and Chester executed a study examining the childrearing assistance given to young adults and African-American single mothers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Deborah J.|author2=Zalot, Alecia A.|author3= Foster, Sarah E.|author4= Sterrett, Emma|author5= Chester, Charlene|title=A Review of Childrearing in African American Single Mother Families: The Relevance of a Coparenting Framework|journal=Journal of Child and Family Studies|date=22 December 2006|volume=16|issue=5|pages=671–683|doi=10.1007/s10826-006-9115-0|s2cid=12970902}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of extended family members, including aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, and occasionally non-relatives, are put into this category.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot; /&gt;{{rp|673}} In Jones research she also notes that 97% of single mothers aged 28–40 admitted that they rely on at least one extended family member for assistance in raising their children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot; /&gt;{{rp|676}}

Extended family members have an immense amount of responsibility in the majority of African-American families, especially single parent households. According to Jones, the reason these extended family members are included in having a necessary role in the family is because they play a key role in assuring the health and well-being of the children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot; /&gt;{{rp|673}} The extended family members' responsibilities range from child rearing, financial assistance, offering a place to live, and meals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot; /&gt;{{rp|674}}

==Theories==
===Economic theories===
There are several hypotheses – both social and economic – explaining the persistence of the current African-American family structure. Some researchers theorize that the low economic statuses of the newly freed slaves in 1850 led to the current family structure for African Americans. These researchers suggest that extreme [[poverty]] has increased the destabilization of African American families while others point to high female labor participation, few job opportunities for black males, and small differences between wages for men and women that have decreased marriage stability for black families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruggles&quot;/&gt;

Another economic theory dates back to the late 1950s and early '60s, the creation of the &quot;Man-in-the-House&quot; rule; this restricted two parent households from receiving government benefits which made many black fathers move out to be able to receive help to support their families. These rules were later abolished when the Supreme Court ruled against these exclusions in the case of [[King v. Smith|King vs Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theroot.com/welfare-fathers-and-those-persistent-myths-1790864434|title=Welfare, Fathers and Those Persistent Myths|last=Gordy|first=Cynthia|website=The Root|date=17 June 2011 |language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic status has proved to not always negatively affect single-parent homes, however. Rather, in an 1880 census, there was a positive relationship between the number of black single-parent homes and per-capita county wealth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruggles&quot; /&gt; Moreover,  [[literate]] young mothers in the 1880s were less likely to reside in a home with a spouse than illiterate mothers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruggles&quot; /&gt; This suggests that economic factors following slavery alone cannot account for the family styles seen by African Americans since blacks who were illiterate and lived in the worst neighborhoods were the most likely to live in a two-parent home.

===Traditional African influences===
Other explanations incorporate social mechanisms for the specific patterns of the African American family structure. Some researchers point to differences in norms regarding the need to live with a spouse and with children for African-Americans.  Patterns seen in traditional African cultures are also considered a source for the current trends in single-parent homes. As noted by Antonio McDaniel, the reliance of African-American families on [[kinship]] networks for financial, emotional, and social support can be traced back to African cultures, where the emphasis was on extended families, rather than the nuclear family.&lt;ref name=McDaniel&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDaniel|first=Antonio|title=The Power of Culture: A Review of the Idea of Africa's Influence on Family Structure in Antebellum America|journal=Journal of Family History|year=1990|volume=15|issue=2|pages=225–238|doi=10.1177/036319909001500113|s2cid=143705470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have hypothesized that these African traditions were modified by experiences during slavery, resulting in a current African-American family structure that relies more on extended kin networks.&lt;ref name=McDaniel /&gt; The author notes that slavery caused a unique situation for African slaves in that it alienated them from both true African and white culture so that slaves could not identify completely with either culture. As a result, slaves were culturally adaptive and formed family structures that best suit their environment and situation.&lt;ref name=McDaniel /&gt;

=== Post-1960s expansion of the U.S. welfare state ===
{{Main|Great Society|Social programs in the United States}}
The American economists [[Walter E. Williams]] and [[Thomas Sowell]] argue that the significant expansion of federal welfare under the [[Great Society]] programs beginning in the 1960s contributed to the destruction of African American families.&lt;ref name=&quot;victimhood rhetoric&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://walterewilliams.com/victimhood-rhetoric-or-reality/|title=Victimhood: Rhetoric or reality?|first=Walter E.|last=Williams|agency=Creators Syndicate|work=Jewish World Review|date=June 8, 2005|access-date=June 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051111144501/http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/wew/articles/05/reality.html|archive-date=November 11, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;painful anniversary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Sowell|first=Thomas|url=http://www.creators.com/opinion_show.cfm?next=1&amp;ColumnsName=tso|title=A painful anniversary|publisher=Creators Syndicate|date=August 16, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040818140004/http://www.creators.com/opinion_show.cfm?next=1&amp;ColumnsName=tso|archive-date=August 18, 2004|access-date=June 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sowell has argued: &quot;The black family, which had survived centuries of slavery and discrimination, began rapidly disintegrating in the liberal welfare state that subsidized unwed pregnancy and changed welfare from an emergency rescue to a way of life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;painful anniversary&quot; /&gt;

There are several other factors which may have accelerated decline of the black family structure such as 1) The advancement of technology lessening the need for manual labor to more technical know-how labor; and 2) The women's rights movement in general opened up employment positions increasing competition, especially from white women, in many non-traditional areas which skilled blacks may have contributed to maintain their family structure in the midst of the rise of the cost of living.&lt;ref name=&quot;Women's Movement&quot;&gt;MacLean, Nancy.

===Decline of black marriages===
{{See also|Marriage in the United States}}

The rate of African American [[marriage]] is consistently lower than White Americans, and is declining.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dixon | first1 = P | year = 2009 | title = Marriage among African Americans: What does the research reveal? | journal = Journal of African American Studies | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 29–46 | doi=10.1007/s12111-008-9062-5| s2cid = 143539013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These trends are so pervasive that families who are married are considered a minority family structure for black people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon&quot;/&gt; In 1970, 64% of adult African Americans were married. This rate was cut in half by 2004, when it was 32%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon&quot;/&gt; In 2004, 45% of African Americans had never been married compared to only 25% of White Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon&quot;/&gt;

While research has shown that marriage rates have dropped for African Americans, the birth rate has not. Thus, the number of single-parent homes has risen dramatically for black women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Social Inequality&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Social Inequality|year=2004|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation|isbn=978-0-87154-621-0|author1=David T. Euwood |author2=Christopher Jencks |editor=Kathryn M. Neckerman}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the low rates of African American marriages is high age of first marriage for many African Americans. For African American women, the marriage rate increases with age compared to White Americans who follow the same trends but marry at younger ages than African Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon&quot;/&gt;

One study found that the average age of marriage for black women with a high school degree was 21.8 years compared to 20.8 years for white women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon&quot;/&gt; Fewer labor force opportunities and a decline in real earnings for black males since 1960 are also recognized as sources of increasing marital instability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruggles Divorce&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruggles|first=Steven|title=The rise of divorce and separation in the United States, 1880–1990|journal=Demography|year=1997|volume=34|issue=4|pages=455–466|doi=10.2307/3038300|pmid=9545625|pmc=3065932|jstor=3038300}}&lt;/ref&gt; As some researchers argue, these two trends have led to a pool of fewer desirable male partners and thus resulted in more divorces.

One type of marriage that has declined is the [[shotgun marriage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Akerlof&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Akerlof | first1 = G. A. | last2 = Yellen | first2 = J.

===Rise in divorce rates===
{{See also|Divorce in the United States}}

For African Americans who do marry, the rate of [[divorce]] is higher than White Americans. While the trend is the same for both African Americans and White Americans, with at least half of marriages for the two groups ending in divorce, the rate of divorce tends to be consistently higher for African Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon&quot;/&gt;  African Americans also tend to spend less time married than White Americans. Overall, African Americans are married at a later age, spend less time married and are more likely to be divorced than White Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon&quot;/&gt;

The decline and low success rate of black marriages is crucial for study because many African Americans achieve a middle-class status through marriage and the likelihood of children growing up in poverty is tripled for those in single-parent rather than two-parent homes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon&quot;/&gt; Some researchers suggest that the reason for the rise in divorce rates is the increasing acceptability of divorces. The decline in social stigma of divorce has led to a decrease in the number of legal barriers of getting a divorce, thus making it easier for couples to divorce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruggles Divorce&quot; /&gt; In addition to social sanction, expanded access to legal institutions by poor communities, mainly brought about by the Neighborhood Legal Services Program (LSP) as part of the War on Poverty (1965),  is seen as contributing, directly and indirectly, to changes  in family structure flowing from the 1960s, in which marriage rates began to significantly decreased while divorces and nonmarital births increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite periodical |author=Goodman-Bacon, Cunningham |author2=Andrew, Jamein P |title=Changes in Family Structure and Welfare Participation Since the 1960s: The Role of Legal Services |periodical=National Bureau of Economic Research |date=September 2019 |id=26238 |doi=10.3386/w26238 |doi-access=free |s2cid=203278731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black male incarceration and mortality===
[[File:U.S. incarceration rate by race 2.gif|thumb|350px|In 2006, an estimated 4.8% of Black non-Hispanic men were in prison or jail, compared to 1.9% of Hispanic men of any race and 0.7% of White non-Hispanic men.

Structural barriers are often listed as the reason for the current trends in the African American family structure, specifically the decline in marriage rates. Imbalanced sex ratios have been cited as one of these barriers since the late nineteenth century, where census data shows that in 1984, there were 99 black males for every 100 black females within the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon&quot;/&gt; 2003 census data shows there are 91 black males for every 100 females.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon&quot;/&gt;

Black male incarceration and higher [[mortality rate]]s are often pointed to for these imbalanced sex ratios. Although black males make up 6% of the population, they make up 50% of those who are incarcerated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon&quot;/&gt; This incarceration rate for black males increased by a rate of more than four between the years of 1980 and 2003. The incarceration rate for African American males is 3,045 out of 100,000 compared to 465 per 100,000 White American males.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon&quot;/&gt; In many areas around the country, the chance that black males will be arrested and jailed at least once in their lifetime is extremely high. For [[Washington, DC]], this probability was between 80 and 90% in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon&quot;/&gt;

Because black males are incarcerated at six times the rate of white males, the skewed incarceration rates harm these black males as well as their families and communities. Incarceration can affect former inmates and their future in society long after they leave prison. Those that have been incarcerated lose masculinity, as incarceration can affect a man's confirmation of his identity as a father. After being released from prison, efforts to reestablish or sustain connections and be active within the family are often unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dyer|first=W.M|s2cid=12297600|date=2005|title=Prison Fathers, and Identity: A Theory of How Incarceration Affects Men's Paternal Identity|journal=Fathering: A Journal of Theory, Research, and Practice About Men as Fathers|volume=3|issue=3|pages=201–219|doi=10.3149/fth.0303.201|doi-broken-date=1 November 2024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incarceration can be damaging to familial ties and can have a negative effect on family relations and a man's sense of masculinity.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; In 34 states, those who are on parole or probation are not allowed to vote, and in 12 states a felony conviction means never voting again.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Brown |first1=Tony |last2=Patterson |first2=Evelyn |title=Wounds From Incarceration that Never Heal |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/134712/wounds-incarceration-never-heal |magazine=The New Republic |date=28 June 2016 |access-date=25 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; A criminal record affects one's ability to secure federal benefits or get a job, as one Northwestern University study found that blacks with a criminal record were the least likely to be called back for a job interview in a comparison of black and white applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Price |first1=Lee |title=Racial discrimination continues to play a part in hiring decisions |url=https://www.epi.org/publication/webfeatures_snapshots_archive_09172003/ |website=Economic Policy Institute |publisher=EPI |access-date=25 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incarceration has been associated with a higher risk of disease, increased likelihood of smoking cigarettes, and premature death, impacting these former inmates and their ability to be normalized in society.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; This further impacts social structure, as studies show that paternal incarceration may contribute to children's behavioral problems and lower performance in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wildeman |first1=Christopher |title=Paternal Incarceration and Children's Physically Aggressive Behaviors: Evidence from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study |journal=Social Forces |date=September 2010 |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=285–309 |doi=10.1353/sof.2010.0055 |s2cid=45247503 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the female partners of male inmates are more likely to suffer from depression and struggle economically.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; These effects contribute to the barriers impacting the African American family structure.

The mortality rates for African American males are also typically higher than they are for African American females. Between 1980 and 2003, 4,744 to 27,141 more African American males died annually than African American females.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon&quot;/&gt; This [[United States incarceration rate|higher incarceration rate]] and mortality rate helps to explain{{original research inline|date=August 2015}} the low marriage rates for many African American females who cannot find black partners.

[[File:Patrick_Moynihan_1998.jpg|thumb|New York's late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, photographed in 1998.]]
The [[Moynihan Report]], written by Assistant Secretary of Labor, [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]], initiated the debate on whether the African-American family structure leads to negative outcomes, such as poverty, teenage pregnancy and gaps in education or whether the reverse is true and the African American family structure is a result of institutional discrimination, poverty and other segregation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rivers334&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor= Harriette Pipes McAdoo|title=Black families|year=1997|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.

C. Eric Lincoln also suggests that the implied American idea that [[poverty]], [[teen pregnancy]], and poor education performance has been the struggle for the African-American community is due to the absent African-American father.

Black single-parent homes headed by women still demonstrate how relevant the [[feminization of poverty]] is.

While majority opinion tends to center on the increase in poverty as a result of single-parent homes, research has shown that this is not always the case.  In one study examining the effects of single-parent homes on [[parental stress]] and practices, the researchers found that family structure and marital status were not as big a factor as poverty and the experiences the mothers had while growing up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cain&quot;&gt;Cain, D. S., &amp; Combs-Orme, T. (2005). Family structure effects on parenting stress and practices in the African American family. J. Soc. &amp; Soc. Welfare, 32, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the authors found little parental dysfunction in [[parenting styles]] and efficacy for single-mothers, suggesting that two-parent homes are not always the only type of successful family structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cain&quot;/&gt;  The authors suggest that focus should also be placed on the poverty that African Americans face as a whole, rather than just those who live in single-parent homes and those who are of the typical African American family structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cain&quot;/&gt;

===Educational performance===
{{See also|Racial achievement gap in the United States}}

There is consensus in the literature about the negative consequences of growing up in single-parent homes on educational attainment and success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heiss&quot;/&gt; Children growing up in single-parent homes are more likely to not finish school and generally obtain fewer years of schooling than those in two-parent homes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heiss&quot;/&gt; Specifically, boys growing up in homes with only their mothers are more likely to receive poorer grades and display behavioral problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heiss&quot;/&gt;

For black high school students, the African American family structure also affects their educational goals and expectations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heiss&quot;/&gt; Studies on the topic have indicated that children growing up in single-parent homes face disturbances in young childhood, adolescence and young adulthood as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heiss&quot;/&gt; Although these effects are sometimes minimal and contradictory, it is generally agreed that the family structure a child grows up in is important for their success in the educational sphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heiss&quot;/&gt; This is particularly important for African American children who have a 50% chance of being born outside of marriages and growing up in a home with a single-parent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cain&quot;/&gt;

Some arguments for the reasoning behind this drop in attainment for single-parent homes point to the socioeconomic problems that arise from mother-headed homes. Particularly relevant for families centered on black matriarchy, one theory posits that the reason children of female-headed households do worse in education is because of the economic insecurity that results because of single motherhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heiss&quot;/&gt; Single parent mothers often have lower incomes and thus may be removed from the home and forced to work more hours, and are sometimes forced to move into poorer neighborhoods with fewer educational resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heiss&quot;/&gt;

Other theories point to the importance of male role models and fathers in particular, for the development of children emotionally and cognitively, especially boys.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heiss&quot;/&gt; Even for fathers who may not be in the home, studies have shown that time spent with fathers has a positive relationship with psychological well-being including less depression and anxiety. Additionally, emotional support from fathers is related to fewer delinquency problems and lower drug and marijuana use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zimmerman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zimmerman |first=M. A.|author2=Salem, D. A. |author3=Maton, K. I. |year=1995|title=Family Structure and Psychosocial Correlates among Urban African-American Adolescent Males|journal=Child Development|quote=Regardless of the causality, researchers have found a consistent relationship between the current African American family structure and poverty, education, and pregnancy.|volume=66|issue=6|pages=1598–1613|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1995.tb00954.x|pmid=8556888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teen pregnancy===
{{See also|Teenage pregnancy in the United States}}

Teenage and unplanned pregnancies pose threats for those who are affected by them with these unplanned pregnancies leading to greater divorce rates for young individuals who marry after having a child. In one study, 60% of the young married parents had separated within the first five years of marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dittus&quot;/&gt;  Additionally, as reported in one article, unplanned pregnancies are often cited as a reason for young parents dropping out, resulting in greater economic burdens and instabilities for these teenage parents later on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dittus&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dittus | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Jaccard | first2 = J. | last3 = Gordon | first3 = V. V. | year = 1997 | title = The impact of African American fathers on adolescent sexual behavior | doi = 10.1023/a:1024533422103 | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 445–465 | s2cid = 142626784 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study found that paternal attitudes towards sexuality and sexual expression at a young age were more likely to determine sexual behaviors by teens regardless of maternal opinions on the matter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dittus&quot;/&gt; For these youths, the opinions of the father affected their behaviors in positive ways, regardless of whether the parent lived in or out of the home and the age of the student.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dittus&quot;/&gt; Another study looking at how mother–daughter relationships affect teenage pregnancy found that negative parental relationships led to teenage daughters dating later, getting pregnant earlier, and having more sex partners.&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Joseph|title=African American Daughter-Mother Relations and Teenage Pregnancy: Two Faces of Premarital Teenage Pregnancy.|journal=Western Journal of Black Studies|year=1993|volume=17|issue=2|pages=73–81|pmid=12346138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teens who lived in a married family have been shown to have a lower risk for teenage pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whoareisraelites.org/2015/02/06/the-state-of-black-family-structure-2015-a-curse-of-dysfunctional-family/|title=The State of Black Family Structure 2015: A Curse of Dysfunctional Family|last=Yacob|first=Anaiah|date=2015-02-06|website=WhoAreIsraelites.Org|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teenage girls in single-parent families were six times more likely to get pregnant and 2.8 times more likely to engage in sex at an earlier age than girls in married family homes.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=Mignon|author2=P.

==Criticism and support==

===Cosby and Poussaint's criticism of the single-parent family===
{{Further|Pound Cake speech}}

[[Bill Cosby]] has criticized the current state of single-parenting dominating black family structure. In [[Pound Cake speech|a speech to the NAACP in 2004]], Cosby said, &quot;In the neighborhood that most of us grew up in, parenting is not going on. You have the pile-up of these sweet beautiful things born by nature—raised by no one.&quot;&lt;ref name=Magnet&gt;{{cite journal|last=Magnet|first=Myron|title=The Great African-American Awakening|journal=City Journal|year=2008|volume=18|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Cosby's 2007 book ''Come On People: On the Path from Victims to Victors'', co-authored with psychiatrist [[Alvin Poussaint]], Cosby and Poussaint write that &quot;A house without a father is a challenge,&quot; and that &quot;A neighborhood without fathers is a catastrophe.&quot;&lt;ref name=Magnet /&gt;  Cosby and Poussaint write that mothers &quot;have difficulty showing a son how to be a man,&quot; and that this presents a problem when there are no father figures around to show boys how to channel their natural aggressiveness in constructive ways.&lt;ref name=Magnet /&gt;  Cosby and Poussaint also write, &quot;We wonder if much of these kids' rage was born when their fathers abandoned them.&quot;&lt;ref name=Magnet /&gt;

Cosby and Poussaint state that verbal and emotional abuse of the children is prominent in the parenting style of some black single mothers, with serious developmental consequences for the children.&lt;ref name=Magnet /&gt; &quot;Words like 'You're stupid,' 'You're an idiot,' 'I'm sorry you were born,' or 'You'll never amount to anything' can stick a dagger in a child's heart.&quot;&lt;ref name=Magnet /&gt; &quot;Single mothers angry with men, whether their current boyfriends or their children's fathers, regularly transfer their rage to their sons, since they're afraid to take it out on the adult males&quot;&lt;ref name=Magnet /&gt; Cosby and Poussaint write that this formative parenting environment in the black single parent family leads to a &quot;wounded anger—of children toward parents, women toward men, men toward their mothers and women in general&quot;.&lt;ref name=Magnet /&gt;

== Policy proposals ==
Authors Angela Hattery and Earl Smith have proffered solutions to addressing the high rate of black children being born out of wedlock.&lt;ref name=SmithSolutions&gt;{{cite book|last2=Smith|first1=Angela J.|last1=Hattery|first2=Earl|title=African American families|year=2007|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn=978-1-4129-2466-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=285–315}} Three of Hattery and Smith's solutions focus on parental support for children, equal access to education, and alternatives to incarceration for nonviolent offenders. According to Hattery and Smith, African-American families are within a system that is &quot;pitted&quot; against them and there are some institutional solutions and individual solutions that America and its citizens can do to reduce implications associated with the African-American family structure.&lt;ref name=SmithSolutions /&gt;{{rp|page=315}}

=== Parental support for children ===
According to Hattery and Smith, around 50% of African-American children are poor because they are dependent on a single mother.&lt;ref name=SmithSolutions /&gt;{{rp|page=305}} In states like Wisconsin, for a child to be the recipient of welfare or receive the &quot;bride fare&quot;, their parents must be married.&lt;ref name=SmithSolutions /&gt;{{rp|page=306}}  Hattery acknowledges one truth about this law, which is that it recognizes that a child is &quot;entitled&quot; to the financial and emotional support of both parents. One of Hattery and Smith's solutions is found around the idea that an African-American child is entitled to the financial and emotional support of both parents. The government does require the noncustodial parents to pay a percentage to their child every month, but according to Hattery the only way this will help eliminate [[child poverty]] is if these policies are actively enforced.&lt;ref name=SmithSolutions /&gt;{{rp|page=306}}

=== Education equality ===
For the past 400 years of America's life many African-Americans have been denied the proper education needed to provide for the traditional American family structure.&lt;ref name=SmithSolutions /&gt;{{rp|page=308}} Hattery suggests that the schools and education resources available to most African-Americans are under-equipped  and unable provide their students with the knowledge needed to be college ready.&lt;ref name=SmithSolutions /&gt;{{rp|page=174}}  In 2005 The [[Manhattan Institute for Policy Research]] report showed that even though integration has been a push more recently, over the past 15 years there has been a 13% decline in integration in public schools.&lt;ref name=SmithSolutions /&gt;{{rp|page=174}}

These same reports also show that in 2002, 56% of African-American students graduated from high school with a diploma, while 78% of white students graduated. If students do not feel they are learning, they will not continue to go to school. This conclusion is made from the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research report that stated only 23% of African-American students who graduated from public high school felt college-ready.&lt;ref name=SmithSolutions /&gt;{{rp|page=174}} Hatterly suggests that the government invest into the African-American family by investing in the African-American children's education.&lt;ref name=SmithSolutions /&gt;{{rp|page=308}} A solution is found in providing the same resources provided to schools that are predominantly white. According to Hatterly, through education equality the African-American family structure can increase opportunities to prosper with equality in employment, wages, and health insurance.&lt;ref name=SmithSolutions /&gt;{{rp|page=308}}

=== Alternatives to incarceration ===
According to Hattery and Smith 25–33% of African-American men are spending time in jail or prison and according to Thomas, Krampe, and Newton 28% of African-American children do not live with any father representative.&lt;ref name=Thomas536 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SmithSolutions /&gt;{{rp|page=310}} According to Hatterly, the government can stop this situation that many African-American children experience due to the absence of their father.&lt;ref name=SmithSolutions /&gt;{{rp|pages=285–315}}  Hatterly suggests probation or treatment (for alcohol or drugs) as alternatives to incarceration. Incarceration not only continues the negative assumption of the African-American family structure, but perpetuates poverty, single parenthood, and the separation of family units.&lt;ref name=SmithSolutions /&gt;{{rp|page=310}}

:({{Find sources|Andrea Escobar}})
This stub article has a surprisingly complicated history. It used to be a  poorly referenced stub on a Miss Venezuela contestant ({{Revision link|405607556|this revision}}) but was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andrea_Escobar&amp;diff=429574472&amp;oldid=405607556 redirected two years ago] to the Miss Venezuela 2010 article. A year later, the redirect was replaced by another poorly referenced biography of a beauty pageant participant with the same name but from Colombia. The problem is basically the same: complete lack of significant third-party coverage. The Colombian Andrea Escobar also landed an acting gig in a telenovela but despite the claim of the article, IMDb appears to indicate that it's a non-recurring minor part. So what do we do with this mess? One option is to revert to the redirect to Miss Venezuela 2010 since we at least have a redirect target. (We do not have an article for the pageant in which the Colombian Andrea Escobar participated) A second option is to just delete because it's quite unlikely that readers will actively search for a non-notable contestant in a 2010 Venezuelan pageant or for an equally non-notable Colombian model/actress. In some sense, deletion is fair to these two women: we just declare them equally non-notable. The last option, of course, is to create separate articles for the two Andrea Escobars and turn the current article into a disambiguation page. I think deletion is the best of the three options.

* '''Delete''' - I agree with the nominator that in this case, declaring both equally non-notable is probably for the best. Plus, the title that the original Andreas held was Miss Yaracuy, which does not have an article of its own. [[User:Mabalu|Mabalu]] ([[User talk:Mabalu|talk]]) 15:41, 20 March 2013 (UTC)

*'''Restore Redirect''' - The second Escobar does not appear to have particpated in a major beauty pageant nor does her acting career indicate any notability.  The first Escobar competed in a major beauty pageant in the form of [[Miss Venezuela]].  A redirect to the entrants for 2010 was appropriate then, and remains appropriate now. -- [[User:Whpq|Whpq]] ([[User talk:Whpq|talk]]) 17:09, 5 April 2013 (UTC)

'''Ida, Lady Darwin''' (née '''Farrer'''; 7 November 1854 &amp;ndash; 5 July 1946) was the wife of [[Sir Horace Darwin]], member of the [[Ladies Dining Society]], and a co-founder in 1913 of the Central Association for the Care of the Mentally Defective (in 1921 renamed the Central Association for Mental Welfare). 

Darwin was born '''Emma Cecilia Farrer''' and took the name Ida from [[Hans Christian Andersen]]’s fairy tale of ''Little Ida's Flowers''. Her father was Permanent Secretary to the Board of Trade [[Thomas Farrer, 1st Baron Farrer|Thomas Farrer]] and her mother was Frances Erskine, daughter of the historian and orientalist [[William Erskine (historian)|William Erskine]] and granddaughter of [[Sir James Mackintosh]]. Thomas Farrer was a friend of [[Charles Darwin]] and, following the death of Frances Farrer, married Katherine Wedgwood, niece of [[Emma Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.surreycc.gov.uk/culture-and-leisure/history-centre/marvels/a-visit-to-mr-darwin Surrey History Centre: A visit to Mr Darwin], surreyccgov.uk. Accessed 5 October 2023.&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 January 1880, she married her stepmother's cousin, Sir [[Horace Darwin]], youngest son of Charles and Emma Darwin, at [[St Mary's, Bryanston Square]].&lt;ref&gt;Births, Deaths, Marriages and Obituaries. Freeman's Journal and Daily Commercial Advertiser (Dublin, Ireland), Thursday, 8 January 1880.&lt;/ref&gt;  The couple had a son and two daughters:&lt;ref&gt;Burke's Landed Gentry, Darwin formerly of Downe.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Erasmus Darwin IV]] (7 December 1881 – 24 April 1915) who was killed in the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] during the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/1609108 CWGC:: Casualty Details], cwgc.org. Accessed 5 October 2023.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ruth Darwin|Ruth Frances Darwin]] (1883–1972) who was an advocate of [[eugenics]] and married Dr [[William Rees-Thomas]].
* [[Nora Barlow|Emma Nora Darwin]] (1885–1989) who edited the 1959 edition of ''[[The Autobiography of Charles Darwin]]'' and married the civil servant Sir [[Alan Barlow]].

Ida and Horace Darwin settled in Cambridge, where they lived at &quot;The Orchards&quot;, a 24-room mansion on Huntingdon Road. A full complement of servants gave Darwin the leisure to pursue activities outside the home. In 1883 she was a founding member of the Cambridge Association for the Care of Girls, an organisation that identified working-class girls who were deemed to be wayward or out of control and placed them in domestic service or sent them to training institutions for service, and that also ran recreational clubs for girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rixon |first=Andy |editor-last=Robb |editor-first=M |title=Youth in Context: Frameworks, Settings and Encounters |publisher=Sage Publications |date=2007 |pages=13–52 |chapter=Chapter 1: Practitioners}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later joined the [[Ladies Dining Society]].

Darwin was also on the committee of the Cambridge [[Charity Organization Society#Britain's Charity Organisation Society|Charity Organisation Society]] and in 1908, in response to the recommendations of Royal Commission for the Care and Control of the [[feeble-minded|Feeble-Minded]], together with [[Florence Ada Keynes]] formed a sub-committee to enquire into the number of &quot;defective&quot; children in Borough schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodcock&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Woodcock |first=John |date=c. 1983 |title=75 Years of Voluntary Endeavour: a review of the work of the Cambridgeshire Mental Welfare Association 1908-1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sub-committee became the Cambridge Association for the Care of the Feeble-Minded and members included the Mayor of Cambridge, the [[Regius Professor of Physic (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Medicine]] and representatives from the Borough Education Committee, the Eastern Counties Asylum in Colchester and the Cambridge Association for the Care of Girls. The group campaigned for the passage of legislation that would put the recommendations of the Royal Commission into force and organised meetings and conferences. In 1912 the Association, jointly with Cambridge University Eugenics Society, held a meeting in the Guildhall, where [[Ellen Pinsent]] read a paper on ''Mental Defect and its Social Dangers''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Notes&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blackman |first1=Elsie |last2=Rootham |first2=Rosamund|date=1951 |title=Notes on the history of Cambridgeshire Mental Welfare Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Mental Deficiency Act 1913|Mental Deficiency Act]] was passed in 1913 the Association merged with the Cambridgeshire Voluntary Association for the Care of the Mentally Defective, which had just been formed by the County Council. This organisation was affiliated to the Central Association for the Care of the Mentally Defective (later the Central Association for Mental Welfare).&lt;ref name=&quot;Notes&quot;/&gt; Darwin was a vice-president of the Central Association for Mental Welfare and as such was a signatory to a letter to ''[[The Times]]'' in 1929 calling for the segregation and supervision of existing defectives and an inquiry into the causes of mental deficiency:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Since its formation in 1914 the Central Association for Mental Welfare has on numerous occasion drawn public attention to the social problem presented by mental deficiency and to the grave consequences and serious cost entailed by the presence of mental defectives in the community&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 22 July 1929, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Although Darwin reduced her public commitments following the death of her son in 1915, she maintained links with the Central Association for Mental Welfare until the end of her life.&lt;ref name=&quot;thetimes50496&quot;&gt;''The Times'', Saturday, 6 July 1946; p. 7; Issue 50496; col E.&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin died on 5 July 1946, aged 91, and is buried in Cambridge at the [[Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground, Cambridge|Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground]], along with her husband. She had an obituary in ''The Times'',&lt;ref name=&quot;thetimes50496&quot;/&gt; with a further note by [[Leslie Scott (UK politician)|Leslie Scott]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Leslie Scott (UK politician)|Leslie Scott]] KC Hon. Lady Darwin. Obituaries, ''The Times'', Tuesday, 16 July 1946; pg. 7; Issue 50504; col E.&lt;/ref&gt; who described her as &quot;one of the pioneers in this country in the field of social work&quot;. The [[Fulbourn Hospital#Ida Darwin Hospital|Ida Darwin Hospital]], built in the 1960s on the Fulbourn Hospital site, was named in her honour. She also has an iris, Mrs Horace Darwin, named after her.

The Wikimedia Foundation is partnering with [http://www.thenounproject.com The Noun Project] to do a public service &quot;Iconathon.&quot; The goal of this event is to generate 30-40 icons for the public domain, with the intent of primarily using them on Wikimedia Foundation projects. The event is open to the public in an effort to bring talented designers and civic-minded individuals into the process. The event will be held on April 6, 2013 at the Wikimedia Foundation headquarters in San Francisco ([http://goo.gl/maps/xG0lS map]), and will last from 10:30AM to 4:30PM PST.

All icons will be released under a public domain license.

== Why? ==

The primary goal of building new icons is to help solidify the visual identity of the various projects of the Wikimedia Foundation and to bring consistency across the user interface.

Rather than using another freely available icon set, we are building our own icon package because:

* Existing free icon sets are insufficient:
** They often contain icons that are crudely or inconsistently designed;
** They often contain a mix of styles, having been accreted over time
** They often contain archaic symbology (e.g., a floppy disk for &quot;save&quot;)
** They are often incomplete for our purposes;
** They are often designed for operating systems rather than singular applications;
** They are often designed to mimic other icon sets;
** Individual icons have often been repurposed ad infinitum, thus diluting the symbolic meaning of any individual icon;
* We are a top-five property, and should have our own visual identity;
* We have multiple teams working on multiple projects. A shared icon set will help us avoid &quot;style drift&quot;.

== How Can I Help? ==

You can help in several ways!

* Come to the iconathon! We very much would like it if members of the Wikimedia movement community would attend.  If you're anywhere near the Bay Area, stop by and help out.  Even if you don't feel that you have the skills to create icons, you can be a valuable asset by helping us understand possible problems with selected imagery.
* Leave comments on the talk page.  
** Suggest additional icons
** Suggest ideas on how to visualize the icons in our list
** Point out some possible problems with specific icons that may arise in cross-language or cross-cultural situations
* If you've an artistic or design bend, create sketches and share them with us.  We are working like this:  determine need -&gt; idea -&gt; sketch -&gt; finalize.

== Event Structure ==

The event will be structured as follows:
# A WMF staff member will give a presentation to illustrate the specific iconography problems faced on Wikipedia and its sister projects.
# A co-founder of The Noun Project will give a presentation explaining the overall design process and sequence of events.
# Teams of 3-5 people will be formed, with each team including at least one designer.
# The teams will sketch and whiteboard concepts for icons assigned to them.
# The finalized sketches will be collected by The Noun Project.

The Noun Project will be responsible for collecting the finalized icon sketches and rendering them as vector images. They will be published roughly one month after the event as CC-licensed images without a specific owner.

== Icon List ==

The list of icons to be created is below.  These have been broken out into broad categories.  Some icons must be done in sets, or are intended to be part of a larger library.

=== Article Status ===
* Article is Reviewed
* Article is Nominated for Deletion
* Article is Unreviewed
* Protected from Editing (6 levels)
*: This icon will be a &quot;set&quot; icon.  It is intended as a suggestion to the Wikimedia community as a replacement for the existing protection icons (which can be confusing given that the only differential is color)
* Rapidly Changing Article
* Featured Article
*: Another suggestion.  This is intended to be an exploration into quality descriptors.

=== Process ===
* Edit Reverted / Rolledback
* Oversight
* Request Oversight
* Undo Oversight

=== Users and Rights ===
These icons describe different kinds of users.
* Administrator
* Anonymous User
* Blocked User
* Bot

=== System Chrome ===
* Feed / Flow 
* Font Settings (Languages)
* Contributions

=== Education ===
These icons are intended to be illustrative of the [[WP:5|Five Pillars]]. It is highly likely that they will not be able to stand on their own as visual symbols as the concepts themselves are esoteric.

* Encyclopedia Worthy
* Neutral Point of View
* No Original Research
* Original Work
* Verifiability

=== Other ===
* Save Page for Offline Reading
* Thank You, Gratitude
* User Feedback

=== Low Priority ===
These icons may be interesting to create or brainstorm about but may have limited use or viability.

* Citation Needed
* New Article
* Wiki Love Symbol/ Gratitude

Galling first took cello lessons and studied the piano from 1945 at the [[Peter Cornelius Conservatory]] of [[Mainz]] with Louise Wandel. He studied at the [[Hochschule für Musik Mainz]], counterpoint with [[Günter Raphael]], and chamber music and musicology with [[Günter Kehr]]. In 1956 he was in the master class of [[Hans Leygraf]], followed by concerts in Germany and tours of Western Europe, the U.S., Israel and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Bio/Galling-Martin.htm|title=Martin Galling (Harpsichord, Piano)|publisher=Bach Cantatas|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galling was a soloist on numerous tours of the [[Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra]] under [[Karl Münchinger]], and collaborated with [[Helmuth Rilling]]. From 1970 to 2000 he was a professor of chamber music at the [[Hochschule für Musik Saar]] (Music Academy of the Saarland). In 2003 he founded the piano duo Galling-Olivieri.

Galling recorded the complete [[harpsichord]] music of Bach for a series of six three-LP sets released on the [[Vox Records|Vox]] label (repackaged in 1970 as an 18-disc set by Murray Hill Records).  The series contains all of Bach's major, and many minor, pieces, with the exception of some youthful productions (preludes, fugues, sonatas, and the like), and also does not include a [[harpsichord]] rendition of ''[[The Art of Fugue]]''.  For this recording, Galling used a &quot;revival&quot; instrument, a modern [[harpsichord]] with stops not found on [[harpsichords]] modeled on ancient instruments, including a 16-foot stop (one octave below the two 8-foot stops) and a lute stop which was probably not modeled on the same stop found on ancient instruments. This recording of the complete harpsichord works of Bach is currently (2017) available as a vinyl rip in the form of Mp3 files on Amazon.com.

'''''Tears of the Enchanted Mainframe''''' is the debut album by the American [[Hard rock]] band [[Buffalocomotive]], released worldwide via [[iTunes]] and [[Amazon MP3]] on August 27, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150208034557/https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/tears-enchanted-mainframe/id556698202 Tears Of The Enchanted Mainframe released August 27, 2012 on iTunes]. iTunes. Retrieved on 2012-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://amzn.com/B0093DNDY0 Tears Of The Enchanted Mainframe released August 27, 2012 on Amazon.com]. Amazon.com. Retrieved on 2012-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Buffalocomotive recorded the album in Chicago, Illinois and [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] between December 2005 and January 2012, with most of the recording conducted via telecommuting. The album established Buffalocomotive's desire to fuse heavy instrumentation with melodic vocals and cerebral lyrics that are both fantasy/science fiction-focused as well as being indicative of the human experience.

==Background==
In 2005 drummer Scott Carneghi reunited with guitarist Marc Kaducak and bassist, vocalist Brahm Taylor, after several previous collaborations, to begin work on their debut effort. Taylor wrote new songs for the project and repurposed older material from his earlier tenure with Kaducak. The month before releasing ''Tears of the Enchanted Mainframe'' Kaducak suggested a re-branding and Taylor changed the band's name to Buffalocomotive.

==Recording and production==

===Recording sessions===
The recording of the album commenced in December 2005 with the drum tracks for &quot;Superusurper&quot; and &quot;MedHed&quot; and concluded with a [[shaker (musical instrument)|shaker]] track for &quot;Tremendous And Wide&quot; in January 2012.

All of the drum and guitar tracks were recorded at a private facility dubbed &quot;Side Saddle Studios&quot; in [[Joliet, Illinois]] with the majority of bass and vocal tracks being recorded remotely by Taylor in Las Vegas.

For the recordings, Kaducak played a 70's era [[Gibson (guitar company)|Gibson]] ES-335TD, a 1993 [[Gibson Les Paul]] Studio, a 2007 [[Gibson SG]] Standard, and a 1985 G&amp;L Cavalier along with [[Randall Amplifiers]] and a [[Marshall Stack]]. He also used a [[Takamine Guitars|Takamine]] 12-string for the album's acoustic tracks. Kaducaks guitars were recorded with SM57's through a Randall 4x12 cabinet with Celestion Vintage 30 speakers. Taylor recorded with a [[Rickenbacker 4003]] amplified through an [[Ampeg SVT]] with the majority of the album's bass sound being derived from a direct signal being processed through a [[Tech 21]] SansAmp. Taylor's vocals were captured with an [[Audio-Technica]] AT4050 mic. Carneghi utilized several different [[DW Drums|DW]] drum kit configurations with [[Paiste]] Cymbals. His drums were captured using Shure Beta 52A on the kick, Shure SM57 on the snare, Sennheiser E604 on the toms and a pair of Oktava MC-012's on the overheads. A Royer R121 Ribbon was used to record the ambiance of the room during drum takes.

During the recording process drums and guitars went through a variety of preamps including a [[Rupert Neve Designs]] Portico 5012, an ART MPA tube preamp and the Steinberg MR816 preamps/audio interface. Analog to digital conversions were achieved through Steinberg, and in some cases Mytek, converters.

The album was recorded and mixed exclusively with Steinberg [[Cubase]] digital audio workstations on Microsoft windows operating systems with Waves SSL and Abbey Road TG12413 plugins. It was revealed that neither Brahm nor Marc know how to operate [[Autotune]], so it was not used.

The songs were often performed to a [[click track]], but there was no &quot;snapping the drums to a grid&quot;, which is a popular computerized technique to ensure that drums are in perfect time while simultaneously sucking the life out of an otherwise real performance.

===Production===
''Tears of the Enchanted Mainframe'' was produced and engineered by Taylor and Kaducak.

[[Backmasking]] is used on the track &quot;[[Superusurper]]&quot; during an interlude that features a reversed reading of a passage from the [[George Orwell]] novel Nineteen eighty four.

The album was [[Audio mastering|mastered]] by Geoff Pesche and Alex Wharton at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London.

==Title and artwork==
''Tears of the Enchanted Mainframe'' was an original title purportedly chosen to evoke the mental imagery of late 1960s science fiction novels.

[[Image:Buffalocomotive Concept Art.jpg|thumb]] The album cover depicts a faceless android with right hand raised in benediction, donning flowing [[kasaya (clothing)|kasaya]] and [[war bonnet]] against a [[Nimbus (art)|nimbus]] of [[blinkenlights]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tears Of The Enchanted Mainframe&quot;&gt;[http://s.pixogs.com/image/R-3828548-1346010371-2357.jpeg Tears Of The Enchanted Mainframe album cover]. Discogs.com. Retrieved on February 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait's artistic style and typography emulates a series of [[Philip K. Dick]] novels published by [[DAW Books]] in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot;&gt;[http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HZnLrl1RL.jpg A Scanner Darkly]. Amazon.com. Retrieved on February 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A loose Native American motif can be derived from the band's name (Buffalocomotive), the character depicted on the album cover (nicknamed &quot;Geronimotor&quot;) and the album title in [[acronym]] form ([[totem]]).

The original idea for the cover involved a photograph of a young girl in funeral attire indulging in a tray of chocolate cupcakes each topped with a different esoteric symbol in white icing.

==Music and lyrics==
To create interest through contrast, Buffalocomotive utilizes musical shifts in song dynamics, going from quiet to loud and vice versa, often placing gentler material against more aggressive fare. All Buffalocomotive songs are performed with the guitars tuned down one whole step from [[standard tuning]] with some tracks featuring an additional [[drop D tuning]].

The lyrics of the song &quot;Mint Green&quot; [[personify]] [[paper money]] as an [[absolute monarch]] and use different shades of green, including emerald, [[forest green|forest]] and [[mint green|mint]], as a metaphor for USD. An analogy is drawn between greed and [[opioid dependence]] early in the song.

Lyrically the song &quot;Often The Orphan&quot; draws comparisons to the uncanny frequency in which orphaned protagonists are featured in folklore, literature and film.

&quot;Tremendous And Wide&quot; was intended as a lament for victims of [[Fundamentalism]], [[plastic shaman]]ism and general [[magical thinking]].

In the United States the album received a positive review in the SNSPost where [[Kevin Abud]] wrote, in a review titled &quot;Buffalocomotive: Tears Of The Enchanted Mainframe&quot;: &quot;Tears of the Enchanted Mainframe is a masterful effort. Thirteen songs as powerful as the name of the band. Not since the likes of Sabbath have I heard anything with the kind of gusto and creative punches that can slap you in the face 13 times in a row&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SNSpost&quot;&gt;[http://www.snspost.com/buffalocomotive-tears-of-the-enchanted-mainframe/ Tears Of The Enchanted Mainframe review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028071811/http://www.snspost.com/buffalocomotive-tears-of-the-enchanted-mainframe/ |date=October 28, 2012 }}.

==Early life==
George Schneiweis (later Wise) was born in [[Pinsk]], [[Belorussia|White Russia]], [[Russian Empire]] in 1906. He emigrated to the United States in 1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miamiobit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oQ9XAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=O0MNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1073,434291&amp;dq=george-wise&amp;hl=en|title=George Wise, noted educator, industrialist, dies in Miami|last=Moore|first=Marilyn A.|date=July 2, 1987|work=[[The Miami News]]|page=27|accessdate=19 March 2013|archive-date=21 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200121205915/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oQ9XAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=O0MNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1073,434291&amp;dq=george-wise&amp;hl=en|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Furman University]] in 1928 and got his advanced studies at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miamiobit&quot;/&gt;

==Career ==
Wise taught Sociology at Columbia in 1930, a post he held until 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;/&gt; He became internationally known as an expert in Latin American and Israeli affairs, with a particular focus on [[caudillo]] dictatorships that were common in Latin American politics at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miamiobit&quot;/&gt; In 1951 he wrote a biography of [[Antonio Guzmán Blanco]], the former dictator of [[Venezuela]] which was published by [[Columbia University Press]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bookreview&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Strong Men Like Money|last=Bracker|first=Milton|date=December 2, 1951|work=The New York Times|id = {{ProQuest|112080405}}}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A known [[Zionist]], he was chairman of the board for the [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]. In 1951, he was named president of the [[American Friends of the Hebrew University]] of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=&quot;JTA1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1951/10/29/3029643/george-s-wise-to-head-american-friends-of-hebrew-university|title=George S.

He became the first president of Tel Aviv University in 1963, serving as such until 1971, when he was succeeded by [[Yuval Ne'eman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Basch_Interactive |url=https://english.tau.ac.il/list_of_presidents |title=Presidents of Tel Aviv University &amp;#124; Tel Aviv University &amp;#124; Tel Aviv University |publisher=English.tau.ac.il |date=1980-01-01 |accessdate=2020-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Wise was also director of the Center for Advanced International Studies and a member of the board of governors for the [[University of Miami]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;/&gt;

Wise was the owner of George S. Wise and Co. and the Inter-American Paper Corp., both newsprint manufacturers. According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', he built the &quot;first [[newsprint]] plant&quot; in Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimesobit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-07-04-mn-121-story.html|title=George S. Wise; 1st President of Israeli School|date=July 4, 1987|work=Los Angeles Times|agency=Associated Press|access-date=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
As a philanthropist, Wise worked on fighting illiteracy in Mexico by founding 30 schools, which led the Mexican government to honor Wise  with the [[Order of the Aztec Eagle]], the highest award given to a foreigner in 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;JTA1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimesobit&quot;/&gt;

==Personal life, death, and legacy==
Wise married Florence Rosenberg, who died on January 11, 2013, at the age of a hundred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wife&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftau.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=17825|title=In Memoriam: Florence Rosenberg Wise|date=January 15, 2013|publisher=American Friends of Tel Aviv University|accessdate=19 March 2013|archive-date=20 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320124912/http://www.aftau.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=17825|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Miami Beach, Florida]], on July 2, 1987, after suffering from heart failure for several months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miamiobit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;/&gt;

Upon hearing of his death, former Prime Minister of Israel [[Menachem Begin]] described Wise as &quot;the dearest man I ever met&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miamiobit&quot;/&gt; The [[Wise Observatory]] and the George S. Wise Faculty of Life Sciences at Tel Aviv University is named after Wise.&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimesobit&quot;/&gt;

This user created an (auto)biographical article at [[:Sumit Kumar Pramanik]]. After an autobiographical notice to the user and autobio/notability tags on the article, the tags were removed repeatedly by the IP ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sumit_Kumar_Pramanik&amp;diff=544650731&amp;oldid=544626335]] first removal). Repeated removal and reinstatement escalated to final warning ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A14.139.223.98&amp;diff=544896005&amp;oldid=544895398 userpage diff]) at which point the main user reappeared to remove the tags: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sumit_Kumar_Pramanik&amp;diff=544897438&amp;oldid=544895921 diff]. The IP is registered to Indian Institute of Chemical Biology which is where the user works [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sumitpramanik007]; this is clearly a tag-team operation of signed-in and signed-out accounts to act against normal article maintenance tagging.

Based on a report at [[WP:AN3]], I blocked the master account for 31 hours for edit warring at [[Bhumihar]]. After the block, the puppet (not a new account), came along and made similar edits as the master. Master ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bhumihar&amp;diff=614030887&amp;oldid=614021120]; puppet [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bhumihar&amp;diff=614255474&amp;oldid=614252503]. I blocked the puppet for 72 hours for edit warring, but thus far have not amended the block of the master. The CU is requested not only for these two accounts but also for sleepers as there are quite a few strange edits to the same article. However, those edits may simply be driven by many editors with ethnic biases as opposed to the same individual. Finally, as the two listed accounts, there is little behavioral evidence to go on because neither of them ''talks'' much, either on article or user talk pages.--[[User:Bbb23|Bbb23]] ([[User talk:Bbb23|talk]]) 23:41, 24 June 2014 (UTC) [[User:Bbb23|Bbb23]] ([[User talk:Bbb23|talk]]) 23:41, 24 June 2014 (UTC)

Something is clearly going on here as a 3rd editor, Alexnews, arrived with the same edits. I've added him but in this case the language[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bhumihar&amp;diff=614338188&amp;oldid=614336342] is more or less identical of that of Bhumihar brahmin.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bhumihar&amp;diff=614269927&amp;oldid=614266714] [[User:Dougweller|Dougweller]] ([[User talk:Dougweller|talk]]) 10:19, 25 June 2014 (UTC)

:Yep. I've just added Bpandey89. They haven't edited the article but they are effectively taking the same line as the other two but doing so on user talk pages, eg: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASitush&amp;diff=614390678&amp;oldid=614363173 here] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MelbourneStar&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=614392927 here]. Why they aren't raising it at the article talk page is beyond me but I'll point them in that direction, and also to [[WP:DEADLINE]] and [[WP:CENSORED]]. However, I am now wondering whether this is more a meatpuppet situation, which is quite common for caste-related articles because the communities co-ordinate off-wiki using [[Orkut]] and similar. - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 17:44, 25 June 2014 (UTC)
