<p>This code defines a function <code>import</code> that returns another function, but the returned function is immediately invoked, making the entire block importable as a module.</p>

provide a public function by returning function with name as output

// make this the last statement so the entire block can be imported easily
(import);

<pre><code class="language-markdown">### Function: import

#### Purpose
Returns a function that can be imported as a module.

#### Code

```javascript
var import = () =&gt; {
  // empty function body
}

(import);
</code></pre>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>This code defines a function <code>import</code> which returns another function. However, the returned function is not being used anywhere, it's immediately invoked with <code>(import)</code>. As a result, the entire block can be imported as a module, containing the returned function.</p>
<p>However, due to the empty function body, this block does not provide any functionality when imported.</p>
