<pre><code>// CodeOps. Automatic github feature branching and squashing in separate environments so the tree that looks right can be chosen. Linting, line-numbers on notebooks.  Automatic deploys for angular components with real HMR not this BS: https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html.  Monitor for files that change outside of project scope and automatically build the git index for the changes in that branch instead.

// show a d3.cloud of import statements and require statements

// show a word cloud for these notebooks
