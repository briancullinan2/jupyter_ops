<h3>Code Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Function Call</h4>
<p>The code calls the <code>$TS.screen</code> function, which is likely a part of a library or framework that handles screen manipulation or layout adjustments.</p>
<h4>Argument 1: URL</h4>
<p>The first argument passed to <code>$TS.screen</code> is a URL: <code>'act.com/au/products/act-emarketing'</code>.</p>
<h4>Argument 2: Options</h4>
<p>The second argument is an object with several key-value pairs that configure the screen display:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>zoom</code>: set to <code>0.5</code>, which likely scales the content to 50% of its original size.</li>
<li><code>width</code>: set to <code>680</code>, which sets the width of the screen to 680 pixels.</li>
<li><code>'crop-h'</code>: set to <code>400</code>, which likely sets the crop height to 400 pixels. The prefix <code>'crop-'</code> suggests that this option configures some form of cropping or resizing.</li>
</ul>
