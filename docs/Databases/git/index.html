<p>This code defines a function that renames files within a Git repository by first identifying files to rename using a pattern and then executing Git commands to perform the renaming.  It utilizes a third-party <code>renamer</code> module to help with the file identification and renaming process.</p>
<a href="./test_github_renamer.html">test github renamer</a>

<p>This code snippet is a test case for the <code>renameUsingGit</code> function, aiming to rename all <code>.css</code> files to <code>.scss</code> within a specific Git repository.</p>
<a href="./json_git_tree.html">json git tree</a>

<p>This code analyzes a Git repository and generates a structured representation of its commit history, essentially creating a visual &quot;tree&quot; of branches and commits that can be used for visualization or further processing.</p>
<a href="./source_tree.html">source tree</a>

<p>This code manages and visualizes Git branches by resetting them to their parent commits and generating SVG representations of the resulting tree structure.</p>
<a href="./Display_graphs_of_different_commands_and_scenarios_using_dry-run.html">Display graphs of different commands and scenarios using dry-run</a>

<p>This code defines a function that compares two specific Git commits within a project, outputs the differences to a directory, and utilizes Gulp and Promises for task management.</p>
<a href="./update_git.html">update git</a>

<p>This code automates a Git rebase and npm package installation process by creating a calendar event that executes a script containing these commands.  The event is configured to run within a specified project directory.</p>
<a href="./github_updates.html">github updates</a>

<p>This code automates Git repository and build workflows using calendar events, triggering builds and tests while also updating existing events with the latest commit information.</p>
<a href="./_git_project_directory.html">,git project directory</a>

<p>This code provides tools for cloning and creating deep copies of Git repositories, allowing for isolated project environments for testing or experimentation.</p>
<a href="./glob_git_branch.html">glob git branch</a>

<p>The <code>globBranch</code> function automates the process of cloning a Git repository, resetting to a specific commit, and creating new branches based on modified files matching provided patterns.  It simplifies the workflow of isolating and managing changes within a project.</p>
<a href="./convert_git_history_to_google_calendar_events.html">convert git history to google calendar events</a>

<p>This code provides utilities for interacting with Git repositories, enabling you to fetch remote information, retrieve branch names, and parse commit logs.</p>
