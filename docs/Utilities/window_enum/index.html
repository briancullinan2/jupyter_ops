<p>Here's a two-sentence summary of the code:</p>
<p>This macOS code retrieves a list of open windows and their titles, storing them in global variables and using two functions: <code>enumWindows</code> to get the list of windows and <code>getTitle</code> to retrieve the title of each window. The <code>main</code> function iterates over the list of windows, calling <code>getTitle</code> to print each title to the console.</p>

<p>Here's a summary of the <code>getTitle(int i)</code> function in one sentence:</p>
<p>The <code>getTitle(int i)</code> function retrieves the title of a window with the specified layer index <code>i</code> by searching through an array of window dictionaries and constructing a string with the window's layer index and owner name.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can also condense the summary into two sentences:</p>
<p>The <code>getTitle(int i)</code> function searches for a window with a matching layer index <code>i</code> in an array of window dictionaries.<br />
If found, it constructs a string with the window's layer index and owner name, and returns a duplicate of this string as a C-style string.</p>
