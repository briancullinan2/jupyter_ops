<p>Here is a two-sentence summary of the code:</p>
<p>The code utilizes the <code>child_process</code> and <code>importer</code> modules to execute external Bash commands and handle errors, with functions such as <code>bashToExec</code> and <code>execCmd</code> to prepare and run the commands. The <code>execCmd</code> function creates a promise that resolves with the output of the executed command and logs the command and its output if not in quiet mode.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of the code in one sentence:</p>
<p>The code combines asynchronous operations with error handling in Node.js, initiating a test suite, executing a shell command, and handling the result or error through custom functions.</p>
<p>However, for brevity I could remove the Node.js and shell command execution to just convey that it's asynchronous and has error-handling in one sentence.</p>
<p>The code is asynchronous, with error handling and uses a test suite.</p>

<p>Here is a 2-sentence summary of the <code>bashToOne</code> function:</p>
