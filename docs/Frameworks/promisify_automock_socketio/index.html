<p>Here is a two-sentence summary of the provided function breakdown:</p>
<p>This set of functions provides functionality for file operations, including deletion, creation, reading, and closing, with associated error handling for potential issues such as permission problems or file non-existence. Additionally, there are methods for sending results or errors to the client, assuming that the <code>$.sync()</code> method has been called beforehand.</p>
