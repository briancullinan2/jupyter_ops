<p>Here's a summary of the code in two sentences:</p>
<p>This code defines three functions: <code>prime_factors</code> to calculate the unique prime factors of a number, <code>overlap</code> to remove duplicate elements from two lists, and uses these functions to calculate the product of unique prime factors of numbers from 1 to 20. The functions are then exported as part of the module, making them available for import by other modules.</p>

<p>Here's a two-sentence summary:</p>
<p>The code imports necessary libraries and sets up ANTLR directory to parse C language code, and defines a custom <code>FunctionExtractor</code> class to extract function names from the parsed code. A <code>get_functions</code> function is then defined to take a code string as input, parse it using ANTLR, and extract function names using the <code>FunctionExtractor</code> class.</p>

<p>Here's a summary of the code in one sentence:</p>
<p>The Node.js module provides a function <code>pythonParams</code> that uses the ANTLR4 tool to parse Python code and extract function parameters, returning them as an array of objects.</p>
<p>And here's a slightly expanded version in two sentences:</p>
<p>This Node.js module uses the ANTLR4 tool to parse Python code and extract function parameters, which are then returned as an array of objects. The module exports a single function, <code>pythonParams</code>, which can be used to analyze Python code and extract function parameter information.</p>
