<p>This code is a placeholder comment for a README file named <code>readme.md</code>. It serves as a temporary note in a project's main documentation file.</p>
<a href="./select_antlr_tree.html">select antlr tree</a>
<br /><br />
<p>Here is a summary of the code in one sentence:</p>
<p>The <code>selectCode</code> function is an asynchronous function that detects the language of a file, parses it using ANTLR, transforms the parsed output into HTML, selects specific DOM elements, and returns the result as a string.</p>
<p>Alternatively, here is a two-sentence summary:</p>
<p>The <code>selectCode</code> function is an asynchronous function that performs language detection, ANTLR parsing, and HTML transformation on a given file. It catches any errors that occur during the parsing process and returns the result as a string, along with an error message if an error occurs.</p>
<a href="./test_select_jison_on_some_quake_3_C_code.html">test select jison on some quake 3 C code</a>
<br /><br />
<p>Here is a summary of the code in two sentences:</p>
<p>This JavaScript code imports necessary modules, defines an asynchronous function <code>testAntlr</code> that interprets and generates type information from a code snippet, and writes the result to a file named <code>tree.json</code>. The function is exported as a module and can be executed asynchronously using the <code>$.async()</code> function, with its result handled by the <code>$.sendResult</code> or <code>$.sendError</code> functions depending on its success or failure.</p>
<a href="./get_antlr_tool.html">get antlr tool</a>
<br /><br />
<p>Here's a 2-sentence summary:</p>
<p>This code is designed to parse a directory structure for grammar files and extract language information for a parser generator tool, likely ANTLR. It utilizes two key functions: <code>findGrammars(directory)</code> to recursively extract language information from grammar files, and <code>getParser(language)</code> to search for corresponding parser files.</p>
<a href="./antlr_to_html.html">antlr to html</a>
<br /><br />
<p>Here's a two-sentence summary of the code:</p>
<p>This JavaScript code appears to be part of a parser or tree-traversal function that handles tasks such as special character handling, filtering object properties, and converting a tree-like data structure to a string representation. The main function, <code>treeToStr</code>, recursively traverses the tree, extracting information from statement objects and using parser objects to resolve rule names and input strings.</p>
<a href="./antlr_tree_visitor.html">antlr tree visitor</a>
<br /><br />
<p>Here's a brief summary of the code:</p>
<p>This code defines four functions for working with Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) generated by the ANTLR4TS parser generator, including functions for converting object types to strings, creating generic tokens and contexts, and generating generic visitors. The code exports a module containing a generic visitor function.</p>
<a href="./cell_6.html">Cell 6</a>
<br /><br />
<p>Here is a summary of the code in one sentence:</p>
<p>The <code>GenericVisitor</code> class contains methods for extracting specific information from the abstract syntax tree (AST) of a programming language, such as identifiers, properties, types, and binary expressions, but three of the methods are currently empty and unused.</p>
<a href="./cell_7.html">Cell 7</a>
<br /><br />
<a href="./antlr_tree_to_es.html">antlr tree to es</a>
<br /><br />
<p>Here is a two-sentence summary of the <code>antlrToESTree</code> function:</p>
<p>The <code>antlrToESTree</code> function converts an ANTLR-generated tree into an ESTree (ECMA Script Abstract Syntax Tree) by performing various operations such as node replacement and logging. It uses functions like <code>selectDom</code>, <code>treeToHtml</code>, and <code>replace</code> to manipulate the tree and create a new ESTree representation.</p>
<a href="./cell_9.html">Cell 9</a>
<br /><br />
<p>Here is a 2-sentence summary:</p>
<p>The code imports modules from the <code>../Core</code> directory and uses the <code>selectAst</code> function to select a part of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based on a specific pattern, then logs the resulting HTML tree to the console. The code expects to receive a specific output in the form of a JSON object representing the AST node, with three different expected outputs shown for different types of AST nodes.</p>
<a href="./cell_10.html">Cell 10</a>
<br /><br />
<a href="./ext_to_lang.html">ext to lang</a>
<br /><br />
<p>Here's a summary of the code breakdown in one sentence:</p>
<p>The <code>ext_to_lang</code> object is a lookup table that maps file extensions to their corresponding programming languages, with 61 entries defined.</p>
<p>Alternatively, here's a two-sentence summary:</p>
<p>The <code>ext_to_lang</code> object is a data structure that contains a list of key-value pairs, mapping file extensions to programming languages. With 61 entries, this object can be used as a lookup table to identify the language of a file based on its extension.</p>
<a href="./generate_antlr_parsers.html">generate antlr parsers</a>
<br /><br />
<p>Here is a summary of the code breakdown in two sentences:</p>
<p>The <code>generateAntlr</code> function is an asynchronous function that performs a series of tasks including globbing grammar files, compiling and transpiling them using different commands and tools, and handling potential errors. The function is exported as a module, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the application.</p>
