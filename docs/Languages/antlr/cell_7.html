<p>This code converts an ANTLR-generated Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) into an ESTree representation, a format commonly used for JavaScript code analysis and transformation.  It leverages the <code>importer</code> library to facilitate this conversion process.</p>


<pre><code></code></pre>

<p>This code snippet demonstrates a process of transforming an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generated by ANTLR into an ESTree (ECMAScript Tree) representation.</p>
<p>It utilizes a library called <code>importer</code> to access various functions for converting between different tree representations, selecting DOM elements, and transpiling code. The <code>antlrToESTree</code> function takes an ANTLR AST as input and modifies it by replacing specific nodes with their ESTree equivalents, effectively mapping the ANTLR structure to a more familiar JavaScript syntax tree format.</p>
