<br /><br />
<p>Here's a 2-sentence summary of the code:</p>
<p>This code imports modules and functions from a <code>Core</code> file, and uses a <code>replaceCore</code> function to manipulate a JavaScript code string. The manipulated code is then conditionally executed using the <code>mime</code> function on a global variable <code>$$</code>, if it is defined.</p>

<br /><br />
<p>Here's a two-sentence summary of the code:</p>
<p>This code reads an HTML file, parses it, serializes it to XHTML, and then parses the XHTML string as an XML document using various Node.js modules. It then uses an XPath expression to select specific nodes from the XML document and logs the selected nodes to the console.</p>
<a href="./babel_transpiler.html">babel transpiler</a>
<br /><br />
<p>This code provides a Babel plugin that modifies notebook code before transpilation, likely for a specific environment, by applying a series of transformations to the code.</p>
<a href="./cell_9.html">Cell 9</a>
<br /><br />
<p>Here's a two-sentence summary of the code breakdown:</p>
<p>The code imports the Babel compiler and a custom importer module, then uses the importer to specify a preset for Babel transpilation. A test code string with a missing import statement is transpiled using Babel, and the resulting code is logged to the console, where it is equivalent to a completed import statement.</p>

<br /><br />
<p>Here is a summary of the code breakdown in one sentence:</p>
<p>The code provides a mapping between PHP and JavaScript functions, enabling conversion between the two languages, and defines various function mappings and a shorthand notation for mapping multiple PHP functions to their corresponding JavaScript functions.</p>
<p>Additionally, here is a brief overview of the code's key data structures and mappings:</p>
<p>The code uses objects <code>fromPhpToJavascript</code> and <code>fromJavascriptToPhp</code> to store function mappings, and an array <code>phpToJs</code> to store pairs of PHP and JavaScript functions, which can be reversed to create a <code>jsToPhp</code> mapping.</p>
