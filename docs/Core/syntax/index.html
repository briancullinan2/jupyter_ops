However, the purpose of the code is unclear without more context, but it appears to be a test case for the <code>getParameters</code> function.</p>
<a href="./get_imports_from_source.html">get imports from source</a>

<p>The <code>getImports</code> function extracts import information from a given code string by parsing an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and selecting specific nodes using XPath-like query strings. It is exported as a module and returns an array of import information, removing duplicates in the process.</p>
<a href="./test_get_imports.html">test get imports</a>

<p>Here is a summary of the code in one sentence:</p>
<p>This code imports modules, defines sample JavaScript code, and tests a function <code>getImports</code> on various inputs, including a file and a string, and logs the results in a conditional block.</p>

<a href="./tree_to_html.html">tree to html</a>

<p>Here is a two-sentence summary of the code:</p>
<p>The code imports dependencies, defines a function to remove Unicode characters, and implements a <code>treeToStr</code> function to recursively convert a statement tree to a string, handling various data types and attributes. The <code>treeToStr</code> function traverses the tree, escaping special characters and including type attributes in the string representation.</p>

<a href="./html_to_tree.html">html to tree</a>

<p>Here is a summary of the code in one sentence:</p>
<p>The <code>htmlToTree</code> function takes an HTML string or tree as input and returns the corresponding tree structure by parsing and recursively processing its child nodes using the <code>accumulateChildNodes</code> function.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can also summarize it in two sentences:</p>
<p>The <code>htmlToTree</code> function uses the <code>JSDOM</code> library to parse the input HTML and process its child nodes using the <code>accumulateChildNodes</code> function. It can handle HTML strings, arrays, and text nodes, and it recursively processes attribute objects to convert their attributes to properties.</p>

<a href="./select_ast.html">select ast</a>

<p>Here is a two-sentence summary of the code breakdown:</p>
<p>The Node.js module exports two functions, <code>selectAst</code> and <code>makeExpr</code>, which are used for parsing and manipulating JavaScript code, and require dependencies such as <code>esprima</code> and <code>escodegen</code>. The functions work together to convert code to HTML, generate string representations of ASTs, and parse code to extract its structure and content.</p>

<a href="./select_acorn_tree.html">select acorn tree</a>

<p>Here is a summary of the code breakdown in two sentences:</p>
<p>The code uses the <code>acorn</code> JavaScript parser to parse code and collect comments and tokens, and the <code>../Core</code> module to export necessary functions. It exports the <code>selectAcorn(descriptor, code)</code> function, which parses the code, selects an AST, and converts it to a tree structure using the <code>htmlToTree(call)</code> function.</p>
<a href="./__make_xpaths.html">, make xpaths</a>
