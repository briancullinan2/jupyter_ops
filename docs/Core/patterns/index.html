<p>Here is a summary of the <code>promiseOrResolve</code> function in one sentence:</p>
<p>The <code>promiseOrResolve</code> function returns a promise that resolves to the value of a specified property on an object, using an optional callback function if the property is <code>undefined</code>, or resolves to <code>undefined</code> if the property does not exist.</p>
<p>Here is a brief explanation of the function's behavior in two sentences:</p>
<p>The function checks if the object has the specified property, and if so, returns a resolved promise with the property value if it's not <code>undefined</code>. If the property is <code>undefined</code>, the function returns a promise that resolves the property value using the callback function.</p>
<a href="./__making_a_class_the_normal_way.html">, making a class the normal way</a>

<p>Here is a summary of the provided code in one or two sentences:</p>
<p>The code defines a class hierarchy in JavaScript using ES6 class syntax, with a <code>parentClass</code> and <code>childClass</code> that extend each other, but is wrapped in an <code>if</code> statement that checks if a variable <code>$$</code> is defined, which may cause issues.</p>
<a href="./extend_prototype_class.html">extend prototype class</a>

<p>Here's a two-sentence summary of the code:</p>
<p>This module exports two functions, <code>extend</code> and <code>override</code>, which create a new class by inheriting properties from a parent class, allowing for property overriding and extension. The functions are demonstrated through example usage and unit tests, showcasing their functionality and flexibility.</p>
<a href="./enforcing_an_interface.html">enforcing an interface</a>

<p>Here is a summary of the code breakdown in one sentence:</p>
<p>This code provides a collection of functions (<code>typeErrorTemplate</code>, <code>standardCompare</code>, <code>arrayCompare</code>, <code>objectCompare</code>, and <code>interface</code>) for comparing and validating values against expected structures, with the ability to handle type mismatches and loose comparisons.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a two-sentence summary could be:</p>
<p>The code includes several functions for comparing and validating values, including <code>standardCompare</code>, <code>arrayCompare</code>, and <code>objectCompare</code>, which compare arrays and objects against expected structures. The <code>typeErrorTemplate</code> function is used to create custom error messages for type mismatches, and the <code>interface</code> function provides a general-purpose comparison function.</p>
<a href="./test_enforcing_an_interface_with_prototype.html">test enforcing an interface with prototype</a>

<p>Here's a 2 sentence summary of the code breakdown:</p>
<p>The code demonstrates the behavior of the <code>myInterface</code> and <code>overrideClass</code> functions, showing how they merge and override properties of an object. It tests how these functions handle property overrides, logging different values to the console depending on the object properties and their order of creation.</p>
