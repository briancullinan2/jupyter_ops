<p>The code begins with a philosophical statement that a program's purpose is essential, and every child process must have a reason to exist for logging and monitoring. A defect is defined as any value other than 1, implying a deviation from the expected default state, possibly tied to the concept of purpose or ambition.</p>


<pre><code>because singularity is purpose

every program (i.e. child process)
needs a reason (i.e. for logging purposes)
to exist right? (i.e. monitor program state)

anything other than 1
is defect (i.e. error,
           derivitive of ambition (i.e. purpose)
           )

<h3>Code Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Purpose Statement</h4>
<p>The code starts with a philosophical statement that singularity has a purpose. This implies that the main goal or objective of a program or system is to serve a specific purpose.</p>
<h4>Child Process Requirements</h4>
<p>The next section states that every child process requires a reason to exist. This reason is necessary for logging and monitoring purposes, implying that the program needs to be trackable and accountable.</p>
<h4>Defect Definition</h4>
<p>The code defines a defect as any value other than 1. This suggests that the default or expected state is 1, and any deviation from this state is considered an error or defect. The term &quot;derivitive of ambition&quot; implies that this concept is related to purpose or goals.</p>
