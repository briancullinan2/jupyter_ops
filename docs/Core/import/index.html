<br /><br />
<p>Here's a two-sentence summary:</p>
<p>This Node.js module builds and loads Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) from source code by interpreting, compiling, and caching DLLs based on source code changes. It utilizes various Node.js modules, custom modules, and notebooks to perform tasks such as interpreting source code, selecting ANTLR trees, and extracting class information.</p>
<a href="./compile_a_dylib_from_source_cell.html">compile a dylib from source cell</a>
<br /><br />
<p>Here's a 2-sentence summary of the code:</p>
<p>This JavaScript code generates dynamic libraries using functions <code>generateCallback</code> and <code>makeDylib</code>, which create callbacks for library functions and compile code into dynamic libraries, respectively. The code relies on external dependencies such as <code>ffi-rs</code> and a core module, and includes unclear or missing parts indicated by <code>TODO</code> comments.</p>
<a href="./display_interpreted_results_in_markdown.html">display interpreted results in markdown</a>
<br /><br />
<p>Here is a summary of the code in one or two sentences:</p>
<p>The code consists of two functions, <code>resultMarkdown</code> and <code>displayCell</code>, which convert arrays of results into strings in Markdown format. The <code>displayCell</code> function handles both single-cell and multi-cell results, reducing them into a single string using the <code>resultMarkdown</code> function.</p>

<br /><br />
<p>Here's a two-sentence summary of the provided code breakdown:</p>
<p>This code initializes and configures a database search system using Fuse.js or an alternative search function, creating two instances with tokenization enabled and disabled. It also exports functions to query the database with a search query and look up cells in the cache by their ID, allowing for seamless integration into other applications.</p>
<a href="./search_notebook_questions.html">search notebook questions</a>
<br /><br />
<p>Here's a 1-2 sentence summary of the provided code:</p>
<p>The code initializes a cache by retrieving and caching cells from specified notebooks and creating a database, then defines the <code>interpret</code> function to process queries by filtering local files, searching notebooks, and querying the database. The <code>interpret</code> function checks if the cache has already been initialized and processes the queries accordingly, storing the results in the <code>searchResults</code> variable.</p>
<a href="./cell_9.html">Cell 9</a>
<br /><br />
<p>Here is a two-sentence summary:</p>
<p>This code provides four functions for filtering and searching Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) in a local environment, allowing users to search by filename, cell number, or query. The functions include <code>filterLocal</code>, <code>filterFilename</code>, <code>searchFiles</code>, and <code>searchQueryFiles</code>, which are exported as module exports for use in other applications.</p>
<a href="./convert_regexp_matches_to_an_array.html">convert regexp matches to an array</a>
<br /><br />
<p>The <code>regexToArray</code> function takes a regular expression object, a string to search, and an optional parameter to customize the return value. It returns an array of matches based on the provided parameters, such as the start position and length of each match, all match groups, or a specific match group.</p>
<a href="./run_all_promises_sequentially.html">run all promises sequentially</a>
<br /><br />
<p>Here is a summary of the <code>runAllPromises</code> function in one sentence:<br />
