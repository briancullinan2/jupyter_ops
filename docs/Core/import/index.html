<p>Here is a 2-sentence summary of the provided functions:</p>
<p>The <code>getCellPath</code> function generates a unique path for a cell in a notebook, returning it as a string. The <code>importNotebook</code> function imports a notebook into a new module, interpreting the notebook's cells and creating a new module based on the cell's language.</p>
<a href="./how_does_node_module_require_work.html">how does node module require work</a>

<p>Here's a two-sentence summary:</p>
<p>The provided code imports necessary Node.js modules, including <code>Module</code>, <code>path</code>, and <code>fs</code>, and defines two functions, <code>getCached</code> and <code>makeModule</code>, which manage module caching and creation, respectively. The <code>makeModule</code> function creates a new module instance, caches it if unchanged, and loads exports, while the <code>getCached</code> function checks the last modified time of a file to determine if a cached module exists.</p>
<a href="./cell_2.html">Cell 2</a>

<p>This code provides functions to format and display search results from a Jupyter notebook in a structured Markdown format, including summaries, matched content, and code snippets.</p>
<a href="./compile_an_es_module.html">compile an es module</a>

<p>Here is a 2-sentence summary of the <code>makeESModule</code> function:</p>
<p>The <code>makeESModule</code> function compiles and caches JavaScript code using the <code>vm</code> module, setting up an execution context and linking the module with its dependencies. If the module has not been compiled before, it logs a message to the console and returns the compiled module instance, otherwise it returns the already cached module.</p>
<a href="./compile_a_csharp_file_into_a_DLL.html">compile a csharp file into a DLL</a>

<p>Here is a 2-sentence summary of the provided code:</p>
<p>The code consists of two functions, <code>buildDLL</code> and <code>makeDLL</code>, which are used to create and manage DLLs from Python code. The <code>buildDLL</code> function interprets and compiles the code, while the <code>makeDLL</code> function checks for an existing cached module and calls <code>buildDLL</code> to rebuild the DLL if necessary.</p>
<a href="./compile_a_dylib_from_source_cell.html">compile a dylib from source cell</a>

<p>Here's a two-sentence summary of the code breakdown:</p>
<p>The code consists of two main functions: <code>generateCallback</code> which generates a callback function for dynamic libraries, and <code>makeDylib</code> which compiles and loads a dynamic library from code. Both functions rely on several modules, including <code>path</code>, <code>ffi-rs</code>, and <code>../Core</code>, and use functions such as <code>importNotebook</code>, <code>interpret</code>, and <code>buildDylib</code> from these modules.</p>
<a href="./display_interpreted_results_in_markdown.html">display interpreted results in markdown</a>

<p>Here's a summary of the two functions in one or two sentences:</p>
<p>The module contains two functions, <code>resultMarkdown</code> and <code>displayCell</code>, which format the result of a search into a markdown string. The <code>resultMarkdown</code> function takes an object as input, while the <code>displayCell</code> function takes an array of objects and uses either <code>resultMarkdown</code> or its own logic to generate a markdown-formatted string.</p>
<a href="./search_jupter_notebooks_for_questions_and_answers.html">search jupter notebooks for questions and answers</a>

<p>Here is a two-sentence summary of the code:</p>
<p>This code provides a database functionality with search capabilities using the Fuse.js library and a custom Levenshtein distance search, allowing for fuzzy string queries and cache management. It exports three functions: <code>createDatabase</code>, <code>queryDatabase</code>, and <code>lookupCell</code>, which can be imported and used in other parts of the application.</p>
<a href="./search_notebook_questions.html">search notebook questions</a>

<p>Here is a two-sentence summary of the code:</p>
<p>This JavaScript code initializes a cache and loads various notebooks, including their cells and metadata, using asynchronous functions and imported modules. It also defines functions to search and query notebooks based on different types of queries, such as file paths, names, and extensions.</p>
<a href="./cell_9.html">Cell 9</a>

<a href="./convert_regexp_matches_to_an_array.html">convert regexp matches to an array</a>

<p>The <code>regexToArray</code> function takes a regular expression object and a string, and returns an array of arrays or numbers containing the index and length of each match. It can also return a single match at a specified index.</p>
<a href="./run_all_promises_sequentially.html">run all promises sequentially</a>

<p>The <code>runAllPromises</code> function executes an array of promises in sequence, concatenating the results of each promise to produce a final array. It uses the <code>reduce</code> method to iterate over the promises array and returns a promise that resolves with the concatenated array of results.</p>
<a href="./parse_cells_from_a_notebook.html">parse cells from a notebook</a>

<p>Here's a 2-sentence summary of the provided code:</p>
<p>This code defines a module in Node.js that imports the <code>path</code> and <code>fs</code> modules and exports a <code>getCells</code> function, which retrieves and transforms cells from a Jupyter Notebook file. The <code>getCells</code> function takes a notebook path and an array of cell types as parameters, and returns a transformed array of cells with added properties such as language and filename.</p>
