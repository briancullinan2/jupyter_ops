<a href="./cell_cache.html">cell cache</a>
<br /><br />
<p>This code defines a <code>cellCache</code> that stores metadata about Jupyter Notebook cells, including timestamps, file paths, and potentially associated questions or prompts. This cache likely serves purposes such as tracking cell execution or facilitating interactive code analysis.</p>
<a href="./cache_notebook.html">cache notebook</a>
<br /><br />
<p>This code analyzes Jupyter Notebooks, extracts questions from code and markdown sections, and creates a cache of cell information including questions, context, and metadata.</p>
<a href="./test_cache_notebook.html">test cache notebook</a>
<br /><br />
<a href="./cache_all.html">cache all</a>
<br /><br />
<p>This code automates the process of caching and updating code cells from Jupyter notebooks, storing the cache within the notebooks themselves.</p>
<a href="./imports_cache.html">imports cache</a>
<br /><br />
<p>The <code>importsCache</code> variable stores information about imported modules and files within Jupyter Notebook cells, including timestamps, file paths, and lists of imports. This cache likely aids in code analysis, dependency management, or understanding the structure of Jupyter Notebooks.</p>
<a href="./create_import_cache.html">create import cache</a>
<br /><br />
<p>This code creates a system for caching and managing imported modules within Jupyter notebooks, allowing for customized caches based on search criteria.</p>
<a href="./test_import_cache.html">test import cache</a>
<br /><br />
<p>This code defines a module that provides a function, <code>createImportCache</code>, for managing import caching, likely within a Jupyter Notebook environment.  It exports this function and conditionally initializes the cache based on the presence of a global variable <code>$$</code>.</p>
<a href="./exports_cache.html">exports cache</a>
<br /><br />
<p>The <code>exportsCache</code> variable stores information about errors encountered in Jupyter Notebook cells, including timestamps, file paths, and error messages. This cache likely aids in debugging, analysis, or reporting of code execution issues within notebooks.</p>
<a href="./create_cell_cache.html">create cell cache</a>
<br /><br />
<p>This code provides functions for managing and updating caches of code cells and their exports, allowing for efficient retrieval and use of code snippets based on search terms.</p>
<a href="./test_export_cache.html">test export cache</a>
<br /><br />
<p>This code defines a module that provides a function, <code>createExportCache</code>, for managing export caching, likely within a Jupyter Notebook environment. It exports this function and conditionally initializes the cache based on the presence of a global variable <code>$$</code>.</p>
<a href="./__update_code_cell.html">, update code cell</a>
<br /><br />
<p>This code provides a function to update the content of a specific code cell in a Jupyter Notebook file by replacing its existing code with new code.</p>
<a href="./update_regular_cache.html">update regular cache</a>
<br /><br />
<p>This code provides functions for managing a cache of data, including updating it with new information, removing outdated entries, and ensuring the cache is sorted alphabetically.</p>
<a href="./memory_safe_async.html">memory safe async</a>
<br /><br />
<p>The <code>memorySafe</code> function allows you to execute a callback function safely by checking for excessive memory usage and returning an error if the limit is exceeded.  It returns a Promise that resolves with the callback's result or an error message.</p>
<a href="./refresh_regular_cache.html">refresh regular cache</a>
<br /><br />
<p>The <code>refreshCache</code> function manages a cache of data, identifying missing items and prioritizing the refresh of the oldest entry.  It is designed to be extended to handle updates for modified items.</p>
