<a href="./rpc_groups.html">rpc groups</a>
<br /><br />
<p>This code configures access control for Jupyter Notebooks by mapping specific functionalities to permission groups, determining which users or roles can access them.  It uses a dictionary-like structure to define these mappings, enabling fine-grained control over notebook permissions.</p>
<a href="./get_cell_rpc_groups.html">get cell rpc groups</a>
<br /><br />
<p>This code categorizes code cells into predefined groups based on their language, content, metadata, and other factors, likely for organization or analysis within a code editor.</p>
<a href="./rpc_permissions.html">rpc permissions</a>
<br /><br />
<p>This code defines a function <code>getPermissions</code> that determines the permissions for code cells based on a search query, combining predefined public permissions with cell-specific classifications.</p>
<a href="./test_get_permissions.html">test get permissions</a>
<br /><br />
<p>The <code>groupPermissions</code> function filters and organizes code cell permissions based on provided groups and optional search queries, allowing for fine-grained access control.</p>
<a href="./filter_command_permission.html">filter command permission</a>
<br /><br />
<p>This code processes user commands, checks for duplicates, retrieves user settings, and prepares the command for potential execution, likely as a scheduled Google Calendar event.</p>
<a href="./store_rpc_result.html">store rpc result</a>
<br /><br />
<p>This code manages the execution and storage of RPC commands as Google Calendar events, allowing for tracking and logging of command history.</p>
<a href="./rpc_result.html">rpc result</a>
<br /><br />
<p>The <code>getResult</code> function acts as a command dispatcher, verifying user permissions and extracting parameters before executing a requested command.</p>
<a href="./get_environment.html">get environment</a>
<br /><br />
<p>This code defines an environment configuration using Mustache templating, allowing for dynamic generation of settings based on environment variables.</p>
<a href="./get_rpc_from_spec.html">get rpc from spec</a>
<br /><br />
<p>This code converts an OpenAPI specification into a format compatible with Google Discovery, facilitating integration with Google APIs.</p>
<a href="./test_rpc_from_spec.html">test rpc from spec</a>
<br /><br />
<p>This code automates the process of fetching API discovery documents, converting them to a specific format, and saving them to local files. It is likely used to prepare API documentation or configuration for a system that relies on Google Discovery.</p>
