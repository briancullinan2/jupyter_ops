<p>This code generates a word cloud visualization of a project's imported packages and relative files, using a custom <code>importer</code> module and the <code>d3.ipynb</code> library for word cloud creation.</p>
<a href="./project_imports_d3_tree.html">project imports d3 tree</a>

<p>This code generates a visual representation of a project's code structure as a tree, using imported files and relative paths to determine relationships between code components.</p>
<a href="./__glob_files.html">, glob files</a>

<p>This code implements a custom <code>glob</code> function that recursively searches a directory for files matching specified patterns, while also considering ignore rules.</p>
<a href="./cell_4.html">Cell 4</a>

<a href="./list_project_files.html">list project files</a>

<p>This code provides a module for listing files within a project directory, allowing for the exclusion of files based on ignore patterns. It uses a <code>glob</code> function to match files and suggests incorporating more comprehensive ignore patterns from a gitignore library.</p>
<a href="./common_ignore_paths.html">common ignore paths</a>

<p>This code defines a list of file and directory patterns to be ignored, commonly used for excluding unwanted files during various tasks.  It exports this list as a module, making it reusable in other parts of an application.</p>
<a href="./List_all_projects_by_names.html">List all projects by names</a>

<p>This code automates the process of finding and listing projects within a directory by identifying common project configuration files.</p>
<a href="./cell_8.html">Cell 8</a>

<a href="./fix_project_paths.html">fix project paths</a>

<p>This code automates the process of fixing import statements and updating dependencies in a project by analyzing code files and identifying missing imports and dependencies.</p>
<a href="./cell_10.html">Cell 10</a>

<a href="./__________________1__________.html">(=\{((:[^{}]++|\{(1)\})++)\})</a>

<p>This code analyzes source code files (JavaScript, TypeScript, or C#) within a project to identify and extract long functions, providing information about their location and content.  It uses regular expressions and file system operations to locate and process the code.</p>
<a href="./cell_12.html">Cell 12</a>

<a href="./file_tools__match_filename.html">file tools, match filename</a>

<p>This code provides a way to map filenames to specific locations within a project directory based on predefined patterns, enabling flexible file organization and processing.</p>
<a href="./mkdirp.html">mkdirp</a>

<p>This code provides a <code>mkdirpSync</code> function that safely creates directories, automatically creating any necessary parent directories along the way.  It handles potential errors, such as &quot;No such file or directory&quot; by recursively creating parent directories.</p>
<a href="./changing_file_names.html">changing file names</a>

<p>This code provides two utility functions, <code>chext</code> and <code>chroot</code>, for manipulating file paths: <code>chext</code> changes a file's extension, while <code>chroot</code> rewrites a file path by removing a specified root directory and joining it with a new output directory.</p>
<a href="./use_memory-fs_and_rewire_to_audit_cli_events.html">use memory-fs and rewire to audit cli events</a>

<p>This code provides a <code>mockTypescriptFs</code> function that sets up a mock file system for testing TypeScript code by replacing its file system interactions with an in-memory file system.</p>
<a href="./TODO__combine_with_DOM_minimizing_service_from_recording_app.html">TODO: combine with DOM minimizing service from recording app</a>

<p>This script processes Jupyter Notebook files in a given directory, updating their metadata, specifically setting <code>nbformat_minor</code> to 0 and potentially adding Colab-related metadata (currently commented out).  It reads each notebook's JSON content, modifies it, and then saves the changes back to the original files.</p>
