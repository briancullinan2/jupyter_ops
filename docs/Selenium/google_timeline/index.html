<a href="./Read_single_google_timeline_page.html">Read single google timeline page</a>

<p>This code snippet extracts structured timeline data, such as dates, titles, durations, and locations, from a webpage, likely a social media platform or personal website. It uses XPath expressions to target specific elements and <code>chrono-node</code> to parse dates from the extracted text.</p>
<a href="./Find_the_average_latitute_and_longitude_at_each_destination.html">Find the average latitute and longitude at each destination</a>

<p>This code processes Google Timeline data to identify and categorize destinations by finding nearby geographical locations associated with each timeline entry. It then calculates average coordinates for these destinations and filters out entries that are not relevant.</p>
<a href="./Reconcile_timeline_data_with_calendar.html">Reconcile timeline data with calendar</a>

<p>This code snippet correlates Google Calendar events with nearby locations based on location names, event summaries, and event locations, likely for analyzing travel patterns or daily routines. It identifies matching events and locations, logging the results for further analysis.</p>
<a href="./Load_location_export_data.html">Load location export data</a>

<p>This code snippet defines a function <code>loadLocations</code> that parses a JSON file containing location data, groups locations by date, and stores them in a cache for efficient retrieval.  It uses a custom <code>importer</code> module to stream the JSON data and process it asynchronously.</p>
<a href="./reconcile_timeline.html">reconcile timeline</a>

<p>This code snippet processes location history data from Google Takeout and combines it with timeline data from Google Calendar, likely for analysis or visualization purposes. It uses Selenium to scrape timeline data and writes the reconciled data to JSON files.</p>
<a href="./search_timeline_events.html">search timeline events</a>

<p>This code snippet provides a function <code>timelineEvents</code> that retrieves timeline event data for a specified date from a JSON file stored in a user-specific directory.  It handles both date object and string inputs and constructs a unique file path based on the date.</p>
