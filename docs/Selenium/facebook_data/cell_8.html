<p>Here is a two-sentence summary of the code:</p>
<p>This JavaScript code retrieves the difference between a user's Facebook friends and LinkedIn connections and sends the result or error to the client using the <code>getFriendsDiff()</code> function, which returns a promise that is then handled by the <code>.then()</code> and <code>.catch()</code> methods. If an error occurs, the <code>$$.sendError(e)</code> function is called to send an error message to the client, while successful results are sent to the client using the <code>$$.sendResult(diff)</code> function.</p>


<pre><code>// How many facebook friends are also on linked in?  Do people still post contact information?

$$.async();
getFriendsDiff()
    .then(diff => $$.sendResult(diff))
    .catch(e => $$.sendError(e))

</code></pre>

<h2>Code Breakdown</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This code snippet is written in JavaScript and appears to be a part of a larger application or script. It retrieves the difference between Facebook friends and LinkedIn connections, and then sends the result or an error to the client.</p>
<h3>Code Sections</h3>
<h4>1. Function Call</h4>
<p>The code starts by calling the <code>getFriendsDiff()</code> function, which is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the codebase. This function is likely responsible for retrieving the difference between Facebook friends and LinkedIn connections.</p>
<h4>2. Promise Chain</h4>
<p>The <code>getFriendsDiff()</code> function returns a promise, which is then chained with two methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.then()</code>: This method is called when the promise is resolved. In this case, it calls the <code>$$.sendResult(diff)</code> function, passing the resolved value (<code>diff</code>) as an argument. This function is likely responsible for sending the result to the client.</li>
<li><code>.catch()</code>: This method is called when the promise is rejected (i.e., an error occurs). In this case, it calls the <code>$$.sendError(e)</code> function, passing the error object (<code>e</code>) as an argument. This function is likely responsible for sending an error message to the client.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Error Handling</h4>
<p>If an error occurs during the execution of the <code>getFriendsDiff()</code> function, the <code>$$.sendError(e)</code> function is called to send an error message to the client.</p>
<h4>Relevant Functions</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>getFriendsDiff()</code>: Retrieves the difference between Facebook friends and LinkedIn connections.</li>
<li><code>$$.sendResult(diff)</code>: Sends the result to the client.</li>
<li><code>$$.sendError(e)</code>: Sends an error message to the client.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <code>$</code> object is not defined in this code snippet and may be a part of a larger framework or library.</li>
<li>The <code>getFriendsDiff()</code> function is not defined in this code snippet and is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the codebase.</li>
<li>The code uses ES6 syntax (e.g., arrow functions, promises).</li>
</ul>
