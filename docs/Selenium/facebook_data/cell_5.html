<p>Here is a two-sentence summary of the code breakdown:</p>
<p>The code is designed to scrape Facebook events and send the result or error to a recipient, using a function <code>scrapeFacebookEvents()</code> that returns a promise and is called asynchronously. The code uses <code>then</code> and <code>catch</code> methods to handle the resolved promise and any errors that occur, respectively, and sends the result or error to a recipient using <code>sendResult(diff)</code> and <code>sendError(e)</code> functions.</p>


<pre><code>$$.async();
scrapeFacebookEvents()
    .then(diff => $$.sendResult(diff))
    .catch(e => $$.sendError(e))

</code></pre>

<h3>Code Breakdown</h3>
<h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>The code is designed to scrape Facebook events and send the result or error to a recipient.</p>
<h4>Functions</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><code>scrapeFacebookEvents()</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>This function is not shown in the code snippet, but it is assumed to scrape Facebook events and return a promise.</li>
<li>It is called asynchronously.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>$$.async();</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>This line starts an asynchronous operation. However, the context in which it is called is unclear, as <code>$</code> and <code>$$</code> are often prefix notation for jQuery or some other library. Without further context, it is difficult to determine the exact library or functionality being used.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4>Promises and Error Handling</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <code>then</code> method is used to handle the resolved promise.
<ul>
<li>It calls the function <code>sendResult(diff)</code> and passes the scraped event differences (<code>diff</code>) as an argument.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <code>catch</code> method is used to handle any errors that occur during the promise chain.
<ul>
<li>It calls the function <code>sendError(e)</code> and passes the error object (<code>e</code>) as an argument.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4>Unrelated Variables</h4>
<p>The code snippet uses <code>$</code> and <code>$$</code> but the only function called is <code>scrapeFacebookEvents()</code>, <code>sendResult(diff)</code> and <code>sendError(e)</code>.</p>
