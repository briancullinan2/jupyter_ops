<p>Here's a summary of the code breakdown in one sentence:</p>
<p>The JavaScript code snippet initiates an asynchronous operation with <code>$$.async()</code> and handles the result or error using the <code>.then()</code> and <code>.catch()</code> methods, passing the result to <code>$$.sendResult()</code> or the error to <code>$$.sendError()</code>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, here's a two-sentence summary:</p>
<p>The code starts with <code>$$.async()</code> to initiate an asynchronous operation and continues with a promise resolution and error handling using <code>.then()</code> and <code>.catch()</code>. The result or error is then passed to specific functions within a framework or library, indicated by the <code>$.$$</code> namespace.</p>
