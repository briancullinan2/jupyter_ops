<p>This JavaScript code implements the FizzBuzz challenge, which prints &quot;Fizz&quot; for multiples of 3, &quot;Buzz&quot; for multiples of 5, &quot;FizzBuzz&quot; for multiples of both, and the number itself otherwise, from 1 to 100.</p>

<p>Here is a two-sentence summary of the <code>isFib</code> function:<br />
The <code>isFib</code> function checks if a given number is a Fibonacci number by generating Fibonacci numbers until it finds a match or exceeds the input number. It returns <code>true</code> if the number is a Fibonacci number and <code>false</code> otherwise, as demonstrated in the provided example usage.</p>

<p>Here's a two-sentence summary of the code breakdown:</p>
<p>The <code>sortDesc</code> function combines two arrays <code>arr1</code> and <code>arr2</code> and sorts the concatenated array in descending order. However, the code then attempts to check each element in the sorted array to ensure it is greater than the previous one, throwing an error if this condition is not met, which suggests a logical flaw in the code logic.</p>
