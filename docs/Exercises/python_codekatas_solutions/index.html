<p>Here is a two-sentence summary:</p>
<p>The <code>palindrome(string)</code> function checks if the input string, with all lower-case characters, is the same when reversed. It does this by comparing characters from the start and end of the string, working its way towards the center, and returns <code>True</code> if no mismatches are found.</p>

<p>Here's a 2-sentence summary of the <code>merge(a, b)</code> function:</p>
<p>The <code>merge(a, b)</code> function merges two sorted lists <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> in descending order into a single list, with a time complexity of O(n log n). It does this using a list comprehension that pops the largest element from either list at each iteration, as implemented by <code>return [max(a, b).pop(0) for _ in a+b]</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>last_word_length</code> function takes a string as input and returns the length of its last word. It does this by counting non-space characters from the end of the string until it encounters a space.</p>

<br /><br />
<p>The <code>find_in_sorted</code> function performs a binary search on a sorted list of numbers to find a target value, returning its index if found, and -1 otherwise. It uses a binary search algorithm to efficiently search through the list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.</p>

<p>Here is a two-sentence summary of the code breakdown:</p>
<p>The <code>simplify_path</code> function takes a Unix-style file path as input, splits it into tokens, and uses a stack to remove unnecessary directory references, returning the simplified path. The function handles various edge cases, including parent directories (<code>..</code>), multiple parent directories (<code>...</code>), and trailing slashes.</p>

<p>Here is a two-sentence summary of the <code>create_max</code> function:<br />
The <code>create_max</code> function takes an input number <code>num</code> as a string and an integer <code>k</code> as parameters, returning the maximum number that can be formed by removing digits from <code>num</code> and keeping at most <code>k</code> digits. The function uses a stack to iteratively select the largest digits from <code>num</code> until a maximum number of <code>k</code> digits have been chosen.</p>

<p>Here's a summary of the code breakdown in one sentence:</p>
<p>The code implements a singly linked list node class (<code>ListNode</code>) and a function (<code>reverse_list</code>) to reversely iterate through the linked list, swapping the next node reference, and returning the new head of the reversed list.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could also condense it into two sentences:</p>
<p>The <code>ListNode</code> class represents a node in a singly linked list, with methods for initialization, string representation, and equality comparison. The <code>reverse_list</code> function takes the head of a linked list as input and returns the new head of the reversed list, achieved through iterative traversal and node reference swapping.</p>

<br /><br />
<p>Here's a summary of the provided information in one to two sentences:</p>
<p>The <code>ListNode</code> class represents a node in a singly linked list with attributes and methods for initialization, string representation, and equality comparison. The <code>reverse_list</code> function is a recursive function that reverses a singly linked list by updating the <code>next</code> attribute of each node to point to the previous node in the reversed list.</p>

<p>Here is a two-sentence summary of the code:</p>
<p>The <code>max_profit</code> function calculates the maximum possible profit from a list of stock prices by iterating through the list and adding up the differences between each pair of consecutive prices. The function returns 0 as the total profit if the input list is empty, contains only one price, or has prices in descending order.</p>
<a href="./cell_9.html">Cell 9</a>
<br /><br />
<p>The <code>subsets</code> function generates all possible subsets of a given list by recursively building upon itself, removing and adding elements to create new subsets. It returns a list containing all possible subsets of the input list, including the empty set and the original list itself.</p>
<a href="./cell_10.html">Cell 10</a>
<br /><br />
<p>The <code>string_permutations(s)</code> function generates all possible permutations of a given string <code>s</code> and returns them in a sorted list. If the input string is empty, it returns a list containing an empty string, otherwise it recursively generates all permutations of the string.</p>

<br /><br />
<p>Here is a two-sentence summary of the QuickSort algorithm implementation:</p>
<p>The QuickSort algorithm is a divide-and-conquer sorting technique that uses the <code>partition</code> function to reorder an array such that all elements less than or equal to the pivot are on its left. The <code>quicksort</code> function recursively sorts the left and right subarrays generated by partitioning the input array until the base case is reached, where the subarray contains only one element or is empty.</p>

<br /><br />
<p>The mergesort algorithm is implemented through two main functions: <code>merge</code> which combines two sorted lists and <code>mergesort</code> which recursively sorts a list using the mergesort algorithm.</p>
<a href="./cell_13.html">Cell 13</a>
<br /><br />
<p>The <code>shortest_path</code> function finds the shortest path between two nodes (<code>u</code> and <code>v</code>) in a graph <code>g</code> by performing a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal. It returns the path as a list of nodes if found, otherwise returns -1.</p>
