<p>Here is a two-sentence summary:</p>
<p>This code normalizes feature values in training and testing datasets by dividing them by 255.0, effectively converting pixel values from a range of [0, 255] to [0, 1]. This is a common normalization technique in deep learning, suitable for image classification problems.</p>


<pre><code>x_train = train_features/255.0
x_test = test_features/255.0</code></pre>

<h3>Normalizing Feature Values</h3>
<h4>Code Snippet</h4>
<pre><code class="language-python">x_train = train_features / 255.0
x_test = test_features / 255.0
</code></pre>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This code normalizes the feature values in the training and testing datasets by dividing them by 255.0.</p>
<h4>Assumed Context</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>train_features</code> and <code>test_features</code> are numpy arrays or pandas DataFrames containing feature values.</li>
<li>The feature values are likely pixel values in an image classification problem.</li>
<li>The division by 255.0 is equivalent to converting the pixel values from the range [0, 255] to the range [0, 1], which is a common normalization technique in deep learning.</li>
</ul>
