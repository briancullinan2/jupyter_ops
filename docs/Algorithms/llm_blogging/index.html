<p>Here's a summary of the code in two sentences:</p>
<p>The <code>blogAboutCode</code> function takes a project directory path, timeframe, and model as inputs, and uses these to extract commit hashes, get the diff between commits, and parse the patch. The function involves several steps, including selecting a model, resolving the project path, checking project existence, getting commits, extracting commit hashes, getting the diff, and parsing the patch.</p>
<a href="./parse_patch_file.html">parse patch file</a>

<p>The <code>parsePatch</code> function takes a patch file as input, parses its content, and returns an object containing information about added and deleted lines across all files, along with the total number of additions and deletions. The function uses line type checks to determine the type of each line and update the corresponding object accordingly.</p>
