<p>Here is a 1-2 sentence summary:</p>
<p>This Python script uses the Blender API to import 3D models from various formats (e.g.,.map,.bsp,.obj) and export them as MD3 files, with the option to scale the model down by 50% and export it with a &quot;-half&quot; suffix. The script performs these tasks using the Blender API's import and export operators, with some error handling for specific exceptions.</p>
