<p>Here is a summary of the code breakdown in one sentence:</p>
<p>The <code>createWindow</code> function initializes SDL and OpenGL, creates a window with the title &quot;C++ SDL2 Window | OpenGL&quot; and size 1000x800, and enables double buffering and a core profile, before returning the window ID.</p>
<p>This function uses SDL functions such as <code>SDL_Init</code>, <code>SDL_GL_SetAttribute</code>, <code>SDL_GL_CreateContext</code>, <code>SDL_CreateWindow</code>, and <code>SDL_GL_SwapWindow</code> for event handling and window management.</p>

<p>Here's a two-sentence summary:</p>
<p>The code defines an asynchronous <code>doFrame</code> function that initializes and calls OpenGL functions, and an asynchronous <code>testOpenGL</code> function that creates a window and sets an interval to repeatedly call <code>doFrame</code> with the window object. The <code>testOpenGL</code> function is exported as a module.</p>

<p>Here's a summary of the 3D transformation system in one or two sentences:</p>
<p>This C++ code defines a 3D transformation system using SDL for rendering, which consists of classes and functions for representing points, vectors, and matrices, as well as applying transformations such as rotation, translation, and connection drawing. The system uses the SDL library for rendering and includes functions for calculating dot products, applying composite transformations, and getting rotation matrices.</p>
