Test suites group related tests together.\\n\\n5. **Test Case:**\\n   - `it('should add a bucket', () => { ... })`: Defines a single test case within the suite. The name \\\"should add a bucket\\\" describes what the test aims to verify.\\n\\n6. **Test Logic:**\\n   - `return createBucket(project, bucketName)`: Calls the imported `createBucket` function, passing in the project ID and bucket name. The `return` keyword indicates that this function likely returns a Promise.\\n   - `.then(bucketName => { ... })`: Handles the Promise returned by `createBucket`. Once the bucket creation is successful, the `then` block executes.\\n   - `assert(bucketName.length > 0, 'should have added a bucket')`: This is the assertion. It checks if the `bucketName` returned by the function has a length greater than 0.
